&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sad bc its a fun game with really great visuals and gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;

"I think the AI lore in the ascent is pretty unique and well detailed. If you searching for trivias (i dont know if you have the game yourself or played it, but i guess no) there is a Codex page in the game with lores about almost everything you encounter in the game. 

Races, factions, base lores of the bigger corporations, lore about the different zones, places where you go. (I dont know how to put images here, not much of a writer, sorry &gt;&lt;)

Me personally, i love the layered built of the ""Arcology"". Its city built layer upon layer. Bottom layer is for the technology hidden from the ppls, that keeps the city running, its like a service level.

Then the next layer where ppls live, but still the bottom layer of society i think? And layers by layers you getting higher and higher and the design changes with each layer corresponding to its purpose. 

The game is a classless system, you really build your character the way you want or like. Skills, abilities, weapons, combine them and have fun.

The story is typical to cyberpunk style tales, but not a bad one. Nicely made and im sure it can twist your mind here and there. \^\^

Graphics are wonderful, many shiny neons, everything is very detailed and beautiful, compared to a top down shooter game. Sometimes maybe too beautiful. On older PCs maybe need to play with the setting a bit to make the game stuttering less, but its pretty well made system i think as a naive.

Weapons are fun and varied, both in style and effective use. Armors tho have fixed stats, so sometimes you need to wonder and decide between defense or efficiency, until you maxing out all your passives. (To be honest, no matter how much defense i have, my hp bleeding out like if its not even exist, so me personally like to put more hp on myself &gt;&lt;)

Couldnt try the coop yet sadly, so i cannot comment the multiplayer side of the game. But i have ideas that could be fun. :D

The game can be hard sometimes, when enemy overwhelming you, easy to die due they hitting like a truck. Some bosses can be pain in the ass. Especially mechs and robots, somehow i cannot find an efficient way to fight against those. Even if you use maxed out energy weapons, they a real bulletsponges.

Me personally, i think the game is pretty cool, good, and well made. Im replaying it for the 5th time and still having fun, choosing different weapons and abilities to combine and sometimes just roaming the wilds, hunting for bounties for upgrade mat and for fun. :D

"Actually, i can name one what is really more likely have a similar system like diablo. Not cyberpunk sadly, more like a grimdark universe.

Yes, its a warhamemr 40000 game. 

By name its Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr, not many class, but loot system is more like diablo. Randomised stats on armors, weapons, equippables, also have a ""crafting?"" system, where you can craft gears if you happen to find the right blueprints.

Also you can rework all of your gears, changing the stats on them, to pretty too much rng that. Have many thing in it, but even im not really sure what and where and how to get. 

The game can pretty complicated, especially when your reach higher tiers and endgame. Drop rates are tricky, but you have a system like in diablo, that you can go overlvl missions, like +18 missions what im heard.

Im not really a pro, so im pretty much stucked at +14 missions, with my gears and skills. But its a pretty cool one, if you like wh40k universe.

I also read the last DLC boss was on some shenanigans, so I was expecting a tough fight... but he went down first try without too much of a fuss *(Spider Bots + Chrome Buster Rifle was my offensive)*. Biometric Timestamp + Rejuv Station was my recovery.

"I personally didn't find it bullet spongy, or at least not in a negative way. Enemies take shooting... because it's a shooter. So dying in one shot isn't really or shouldn't really be a thing. You can crouch for a reason, and hide behind cover for a reason; because every encounter is not to be just run and gun.

And as far as the stat upgrade system, it was fine to me. Each skill point increases the stat by 1, but those effects are influenced from two sources in each category. Played pretty balanced to me. By mid game I was running through most encounters, but would use cover/caution for a few tougher enemies.

I guess it all comes down to what you were expecting the game to be. If you're expecting the breakneck pace of Diablo, then it may not be that.

"I recently picked the base game up for 1 dollar, and got the extra DLC for about as much.

Might be one of the best values. I saw mention of it on a top 10 list recently, so decided to try it. Can’t lose at that price. 

Was very surprised on just how cool this game is. Like an Isometric ARPG Cyberpunk. The size of the map and world I definitely wasn’t expecting. It’s huge.

I really like that it’s a twin stick shooter. Keeps it simple but still enjoyable. 

Another thing I don’t expect was all the voice line for NPCs and side quests etc. 

Gem for real.

"Hey everyone,  
We just wanted to share a little dev story here, since **The Ascent has been a huge inspiration for our team.** We love how it nails that gritty sci-fi dystopia, the sense of being a small group trying to survive in a world way bigger than you.

Our project DDoD is a single player and coop top down action shooter set in a post-apocalyptic quarantine zone consumed by a strange purple fog. The fog mutates everything: people, animals, even the environment itself — and players have to scavenge, fight, and push forward together (or solo) to make it to safe havens.

We’re gearing up for our **very first playtest** **this October 3–5**, covering about 30–40 minutes of early gameplay: one mission, some tense combat encounters, and a safe bunker to reach at the end.

💬 As fans of The Ascent, we’d love to hear:

* What elements of atmosphere or co-op design from The Ascent stood out the most to you?
* What do you think makes a “hostile world” feel truly alive and dangerous?

My girlfriend and I have been having a blast with the game, but it'll just randomly crash. Sometimes at a shop, sometimes mid combat, sometimes just walking around.

It sort of really kills any enjoyment of the game.

- Corsair RM850x

My settings:

- Same as hers

The thing is that hers runs smoothly 60 FPS, and mine 120 FPS. No framedrops, stutters or anything. 

No driver crash either. It's specifically the game just noping out.

She has 500 Mbit internet, I have 1 Gbit.

She has crashed 3 times in 5 hours, I have crashed once.

&lt;li&gt;Same as hers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that hers runs smoothly 60 FPS, and mine 120 FPS. No framedrops, stutters or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No driver crash either. It&amp;#39;s specifically the game just noping out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has 500 Mbit internet, I have 1 Gbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has crashed 3 times in 5 hours, I have crashed once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of old posts on both Reddit and Steam talks about random crashes, but has it really not been fixed yet?&lt;/p&gt;

I can't believe this game flew under my radar, but I'm glad gamepass added it for me to see. I would love to see a sequel, but from my research it looks like the studio was bought out and the original devs are no longer around :(

# Buy The Ascent - Artbook + Weapon Pack

This DLC gives access to the game's Digital Artbook (which can be found within the installation folder) and two exclusive weapons that can be purchased from in-game vendors.

# DIGITAL ARTBOOK 

Spanning 85 pages of high-grade visual overload, The Ascent artbook pulls back the curtain on the neon-lit, blood-stained, ruthless world of Veles. Packed with original concept art and high-resolution custom renders of the corpo-run metropolis, characters, branding and more, every page is a reminder - someone built this world before you blew it to hell. 

Pure distilled Cyberpunk chaos awaits you. 

**THE PERSUADER** 

The Persuader is an almost mythical weapon. Not because of its disco inspired pray and spray – but because nobody knows where they come from. They’re as rare as they’re dangerous. Very. The lucky few indents with one in possession are usually very keen to show them off, regardless of it's a good time or not. 

**BITSPLIT SHOTGUN** 

If you're pure organic, you've got nothing to fear from this shotgun. Fortunately for you, very few people are. A few ones and zeros will never quite pack the same punch against flesh as a good chunk of metal, but a completely digitalized weapon is both environmentally friendly and the perfect tool to take out robots.

"I bought it last night for the art book. It has a pretty good fire rate, same for the bitsplit. I've upgraded the bitsplit to use longer in later game levels.

The persuader is pretty fun to use. I don't know if it's just me or my TV, but when firing it. It sounds like it's screaming or something. The Persuader is an energy weapon. It has a 45 clip size, auto fire &amp; 50 on the knock back.  You get it right after you talk to a certain character for the first time.

Hey everyone, I noticed The Ascent is on sale right now and I’ve got my eye on it, mainly for couch co-op. I love playing games like Diablo with friends (fast-paced action, loot, leveling, etc.), and I’m wondering if The Ascent scratches a similar itch.

For those who’ve played it:

How well does couch co-op hold up? Is it smooth and fun or clunky?

Does the gameplay loop feel rewarding over time, especially with a buddy?

Any standout likes or dislikes when it comes to the combat mechanics, world-building, or story?

Does the RPG depth lean more toward Diablo-style loot or more toward twin-stick shooter simplicity?

Would love to hear what kept you playing or what made you bounce off.

"In general, is it better to loot or buy gear? How often do weapons and gear drop?

I’ve collected a few pieces of armor and one gun, (I’ve only completed the first mission). I’ve searched around for an answer to this question and I know it’s not Diablo level of loot drops and I’m aware there are some unique items in levels. But is there some sort of loot rng when opening chests/ defeating enemies? Curious if I should always be checking in on vendors or if I’ll be finding decent gear while out on missions.

"Great game! Level 27 right now. Reminds me a bit of old school loaded and reloaded on ps1, same great coop feel, obviously with better gameplay, graphics, and mechanics, thank God we’ve evolved in some ways. 

If only public matchmaking was a thing, it could’ve even possibly rivalled Diablo 4, imho!

I don’t use mic much, and will probably be on and off it all day today, and many other days.

Add me if you want/can, I have around 5 other people that I play it with, but it’d be nice if I could always play with someone, which sadly isn’t the case, so please help me out with this!

From my initial experience of the ascent, it seems pretty awesome. So I’m looking for some good people to play it with, if possible, as none of my friends play it. It’s currently less than £10 on the ps store, so I snatched it up about 5 hours ago, but I haven’t found any players publicly online yet. I hope it’s not dead!?

Add me and let’s game if you want/can. I don’t use my mic much. I’ve been looking for similar type games and I’m always looking for some good solid multiplayer-rpg-gun-gaming, and so far it seems to have delivered. If you can recommend any more like it, it will be appreciated.

"The graphics / and setting are no where near as nice as the Ascent. 

But CyberCorp has tight isometric twin stick shooting action with punchy weapons in a cyberpunk world.

The weapon variety blows The Ascent Away and there are lots of armor configurations as well.  

The game features a great way to level up your gear through the use of a forge at the home base and so there is a should I look to buy new vs level up my existing stuff kinda push pull. 

There are tiers of gear as well which adds to the strategy of making your build out. 

You get two Firearms weapons and a melee weapon (sword) and the game gives you ability to control turrets drones etc just like the Ascent. 

I prefer the Ascents aesthetics 10000% but I love the weapon variety and the ability to upgrade my gear too.   

Very Good game for fans of the Ascent! 

I believe the combat is far smoother than Slavic Punk which is awful and much improved over Ruiner.  

So if you enjoyed The Ascent, Give CyberCorp a look.

&lt;p&gt;Amazing how it can look so colourful and yet so grimy. And the the depth: so often you can see stuff off in the distance on lower levels giving a great sense of scale. They really went above and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

"Ash and Chrome: chapter I

Setting: The irradiated ruins beyond the Moscow Metro, year 2045. A rip in spacetime — the result of rogue corporate tech in the cyberpunk world — pulls The Ascent protagonist into Artyom’s broken Earth.


---

The Scene Opens…

The wind howls through broken concrete towers. Snowflakes fall like ash, settling on rusted cars and the bones of buildings long collapsed. In the distance, a shriek — not human — pierces the silence.

Artyom crouches behind a ruined wall, Spartan rifle in hand. His mask hisses softly with each breath. He’s tracking a pack of Nosalis — but something else landed just outside the perimeter. Something… unnatural.

With a dull thud and flickering static, a figure appears — metallic implants glowing dim blue through the snowstorm. The Indent, the nameless cyber-merc from another world, steps into this dead future.

Their eyes meet.

&gt; Artyom (internal monologue):
Not mutant. Not man. Something in between. But armed… and watching me like a predator.



The Nosalis strike.

Artyom takes out two with clean shots. The third leaps — only to be mid-air-sliced by the Indent's arc blade. Blood steams on chrome.


---

Aftermath:

In a bunker lit by weak, flickering lights, the two sit across from each other. Neither speaks much — Artyom never has, and the Indent is more action than talk. But both understand survival. War. Sacrifice.

The Indent’s cyberdeck sparks as they try to tap into the Metro’s crude power grid. Artyom offers a hand-cranked battery.

&gt; Artyom: “This world... no wires left to plug into.” Indent: “Then I’ll make new ones.”




---

Conflict Looms:

The mutants are evolving. Something is manipulating them. Whispers speak of an ancient AI buried beneath Moscow — remnants of pre-war tech now infected by psychic radiation.

Artyom wants to destroy it. The Indent wants to control it — a way home, maybe even a weapon.

They agreed to investigate the signal both had detected — a pulsing anomaly deep in the ruins. That’s when they heard it: a voice, half-code, half-prayer.

&gt; “I see you. I remember your bones.”

"I think there is a better balance to be found with spending upgrade components.  Certainly don't spend them on every gun you find, but not upgrading anything until your two ideal guns is just holding you back needlessly.  I finished my first run with few upgraded weapons and a ton of leftover components.  On my second run I upgraded more as I progressed and found it a much easier run, though with the benefit of knowing good weapons to focus on.

Also handy to know is that Basic and Advanced components can be farmed endlessly.  Basics from any Bounty target, and Advanced later on from certain large enemies / mini-bosses which will respawn (Scrapland has a couple).  It's only the Superior components needed for the final couple of upgrades that are genuinely limited (pre-DLC) unless you abuse the respawn system.

I would advise to try out each new weapon as you find it, without spending any upgrades, to see if you like it, fits your playstyle, and is more effective than your other primary weapon for taking out enemies.  A lot can be dismissed at this stage.  Also don't focus much on weapons found L1-10 as those will all get replaced by better variants later on.

My preferred upgrade path went something like HMG Dominator for early game, EBR Enforcer and ABR Commander for the bulk of the game, and collect Dealbreaker near the end.  If you have a stockpile of upgrade components ready to spend on those as soon as you find them, the increase in your combat power is huge.",,theascent,r/theascent,2025-04-09T09:16:18.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a better balance to be found with spending upgrade components.

"If you talking about Cyber Heist last boss, the sniper guy, use melee. He gets tremendous ammount of dmg from melee dmg. 

Also, stay close to him, so he cannot shot you, dont know the exact range tho, but if you close to him, he cannot snipe on you. If you get too close, he will jump away, but with a dodge roll you easily can get close enough to him so he cant snipe you. 

Around 40% hp he will summon a squad against you. But stay on the boss, if you go away from him, his sniper do far more dmg what the whole squad can do to you. Kill the boss, then one by one hunt down the straglers.

With the hydromechanic punch? i dont remember the name of that augment, its actually the very first augment you get in the game. 2 punch with that and he was dead.

Im used the overwhelmer as my weapon, on mk5. For tactical, im used the auto turret. Not a big dmg, but its can distract the boss, but more importantly, the adds when summoned. I did enough dmg to have 3 turret summoned when the squad spawned. Killed the boss with punch and then killed the squad 1 by 1, until they tried to killing my turrets. 

For 2nd augment, use what you like. Tentacle sounds good as its doing ""melee"" dmg i think, tho im never tried that augment yet.

For the passive mods, im used vital signs and the tactical one, so you charging your auto turret summon pretty fast and can just drop turret after turret.

"I really enjoyed the two battle rifles - EBR Enforcer and ABR Commander.

Their homing bullets feature makes a mockery of aim, so you just need to point them in the vague direction of the enemy and pull the trigger.  The bullets find their targets, and the two rifles give you options between ballistic and energy.

I would experiment with any weapon you find to see if you like how it performs, just at the base level.  Find a few you like before you decide to spend components on upgrading them.  Also know that as you progress more weapons will become available, and some are just outright better versions of earlier game weapons, so don't get too attached to your first rifle.

The short version is Basic and Advanced components can be farmed endlessly through bounty targets.  Superior components have limited placement, so unless you want to abuse a glitch, or have the DLC which adds more, plan ahead for only being able to max out 2-3 weapons.",,theascent,r/theascent,2025-04-02T12:59:22.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the two battle rifles - EBR Enforcer and ABR Commander.&lt;/p&gt;

Also know that as you progress more weapons will become available, and some are just outright better versions of earlier game weapons, so don&amp;#39;t get too attached to your first rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is Basic and Advanced components can be farmed endlessly through bounty targets.  Superior components have limited placement, so unless you want to abuse a glitch, or have the DLC which adds more, plan ahead for only being able to max out 2-3 weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

"Hello

Im having some massive skill issues here. I am currently in the Cyber Heist area but this started way before that and enemies are just too many and they take ages to kill, Im talking real bullet sponges here. Basically all the engagements almost feel like a war of attrition rather than a shoot-out.

I just dont understand what I am doing wrong, I see people calling the game easy even on harder difficulties but I am definatelly getting chewed up by the game.

My preferred weapons are Commander or Overwhelemer paired with EBR Enforcer all of which are Mk 10. originally I used Dread but later on it just took forever to kill even a single enemy. I use Mono Ranger and Spider Bots. Tactical Sense, Crit and Evasion are level 20, Hp 10, weapon handling and aiming 15, balance 10.

I try to play tactically by shooting from behind cover while going from cover to cover. I spam grenades, spiders bots and mono ranger every chance I get. Enemies still just wont die quick enough. I use evasion as if my IRL life depends on it aswell. I just keep getting my ass kicked and I'm not sure what to do in order to grind through all these enemy clusters. I try to fall back while shooting them but then all I really manage to do is drag even more enemies into the fight from behind lol.

I enjoy the constant fighting, it reallly makes you feel like you are in one of those cyberpunk artworks where people are always shooting and stuff but its slowly getting tedious since the fights are so drawned out for me.

I love this game, the atmosphere and the music is just top notch but I must be doing something wrong because whenever I see people talking about the difficulty it seems we are playing different games. Does anyone have any tips on how I can remedy this?

"Do you have the Rock Crusher? That thing is wild. I've just done this and followed the guide on TrueAchievements and the fight with Zell himself was insanely easy. I had a **much** harder time with the room where you get ambushed by four guards, and the large floating mech thing. I solved both of them with the same method as below: Lock-On then go crazy with the Dealbreaker.

**Augmentations:** Joyrun Dragon and Lock-On Fire  
**Passives:** Vitasigns Booster (+25 health) and Speedheal Mod  
**Weapons:** Dealbreaker and Rock Crusher (preferably on Mk.10, there’s way more than enough Superior Components in the DLC area for that to be easy to get sorted)  
**Tactical:** Rejuvenation Field  
I’d also recommend maxing out the Vitality Signs, Body Battery, and Critical Hit Rate skills to give yourself the biggest advantage possible. Take whatever you wish for your armour.  
  
When the fight starts, immediately press the bumper tied to the Joyrun Dragon to activate it and put Zell’s squadmates in Stasis (Zell himself is immune to Stasis). Wail on them with the Rock Crusher’s normal attack until you have gotten the light blue bar on their health to about halfway each, at that point they’ll either die upon exiting Stasis or will have basically no health left. After that, activate Rejuvenation Field to heal any damage you may have taken and get close to Zell for him to jump away, which will deactivate his shield. Equip the Dealbreaker (make sure the mag is full) and activate Lock-On Fire. Fire on Zell and he’ll be dead in a couple seconds before he has the chance to call for reinforcements. The achievement will pop shortly after the ending cutscene begins.

&lt;strong&gt;Passives:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitasigns Booster (+25 health) and Speedheal Mod&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Weapons:&lt;/strong&gt; Dealbreaker and Rock Crusher (preferably on Mk.10, there’s way more than enough Superior Components in the DLC area for that to be easy to get sorted)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tactical:&lt;/strong&gt; Rejuvenation Field&lt;br/&gt;
I’d also recommend maxing out the Vitality Signs, Body Battery, and Critical Hit Rate skills to give yourself the biggest advantage possible. Take whatever you wish for your armour.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the fight starts, immediately press the bumper tied to the Joyrun Dragon to activate it and put Zell’s squadmates in Stasis (Zell himself is immune to Stasis). Wail on them with the Rock Crusher’s normal attack until you have gotten the light blue bar on their health to about halfway each, at that point they’ll either die upon exiting Stasis or will have basically no health left. After that, activate Rejuvenation Field to heal any damage you may have taken and get close to Zell for him to jump away, which will deactivate his shield. Equip the Dealbreaker (make sure the mag is full) and activate Lock-On Fire. Fire on Zell and he’ll be dead in a couple seconds before he has the chance to call for reinforcements. The achievement will pop shortly after the ending cutscene begins.&lt;/p&gt;

"I'm struggling with progress all of a sudden. I'm level 18 and I'm up to acquiring the ExMat Lab mission. I was in the lab and being killed but making progress towards completing that area. I had got the boss down to maybe 30% health. After every death I'd spawn right outside the doors to the lab.

Saved the game after dying in the lab and on reloading I am spawning 500m away from it and I can't even get near it ! I'm getting my absolute teeth kicked in. Street gangs are regularly overwhelming me and all of a sudden I'm getting a group of mechs with a ""boss"" mech which I can beat eventually but it's a big fight and 50/50 that I get past it.  I never even saw this guy when I first got to the lab.

Is this bugged ? Did I get too far previously? 

I usually run a levelled up HCF heat and a bigger ballistic weapon but then switch to energy when I encounter mechs.

What am I doing wrong ? I'm getting very frustrated by it ! Big shame as I love this game !.

Thanks all. 

Edit update :- respawned right next to the lab, entered the lab, hacked the computer to set the boss fight off and no enemies, no countdown timer.

"Much of the game is split into a lower and upper tier: Arcology: Warrens and Arcology: High Street respectively. A lift connects the two. The taxi can only take you to locations for your current tier. The taxi also highlights if your current quest is available on a current tier location. Using Up on Dpad provides a tracking line to your current quest. If you follow the recommended level for side quests, there will be 2-3 occasions when your tracking line will get confused. Advance the main quest line to resolve this.

Mobs will frequently drop different coloured charge canisters: Tactical Charge (yellow), Health (red) and Energy (blue)

As your Cyberdeck levels up, hack vending machines for free charge drops.

You'll want to have a ballistic and energy weapon for organics and mech enemies respectively. Generally organic enemies are more prevalent and mechs more dangerous. Good early ballistic weapons are P9000 or RPG23. When you feel brave enough to dodge some level 25 enemies, the Overwhelmer is fantastic. See YouTube for details. The Chrome Puncher is a good early energy weapon, then later the ERB Enforcer or E77.

Use cover but be vigilant of flanking enemies and prioritise those.

Moderate your component spending on upgrading weapons until you have a weapon you are likely to stick with. 

Most builds will benefit from investment in the following skills: Critical Hits, Vital Signs, Tactical Sense, Weapon Handling and Evasion 8 will give you three dodge rolls.

For a health focused Augmentation combination: Life Leech + Spiderbots

Tactical Charge is a great Module to quicken availability of your Tactical choice.

&lt;p&gt;yup, totally true! 80-something skill points. wild :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have around 750k uCreds - should be good to buy whatever you need to fill any gaps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;closer to 100k, maybe 120k?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just sharing all this not to complain (i&amp;#39;m immensely grateful for this share!), but more to inform folks who may be trying this what the save game actually provides.&lt;/p&gt;

"Weapon upgrades are definitely worth doing as they can have a big boost to your damage, but they require you to find various components - Basic, Advanced and Superior.  Play with a weapon for a bit without any upgrades to see if you like it before committing components to it.  You can't un-spend components used to upgrade.

Basic allow you to upgrade Mk1-5 and can be found in crates marked on the map, as mission rewards and from Bounty mission targets.  Since regular Bounty enemies can respawn across the map they are a potentially endless source for Basic components.

Advanced allow you to upgrade Mk6-8.  They start to drop later in the game, again from some crates and mission rewards, but also from some larger mini-boss enemies.  Because those can respawn it is possible to farm these components to upgrade more weapons, but the enemies are more dangerous.

Superior components are the only truly limited components.  If you play the base game the way the devs intended you will only find enough to max out 2 guns, so choose wisely.  It is possible to get more by abusing a glitch, but only possible very late in the story.",,theascent,r/theascent,2025-01-25T11:20:58.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weapon upgrades are definitely worth doing as they can have a big boost to your damage, but they require you to find various components - Basic, Advanced and Superior.

"I played this game when it first came out on my old system with, Ryzen 7 3700x and RTX 3070, and it was playable with RT on when I used DLSS.

I built a new system last year with a Ryzen 7 9700x and Radeon 7900 XT.  This combo has been a pretty significant performance increase in every other game at higher settings so I decided to install The Ascent again and see how far I could push it.

Without RT and most settings at ultra or high, I'm getting around 220 FPS. As soon as I turn on any of the Raytracing options I drop down to about 40 FPS and get a lot of stuttering. Does this game just not like AMD cards? 

I've tried it with AMD SmartAccess Memory both and and off, and no difference. I had to disable SAM to get Spiderman Remastered running smoothly so I though that might be the same here.

This is what happens when developers design a game with a feature for aimed for one specific GPU manufacturer. The Nexusmod can help you bridge the gap, but you'll still need fluid motion frames.

My wife and I picked up this game earlier this week, were instantly smitten, then heartbroken after a 5 hour session resulted in her p2 character losing all progress.

In re-leveling her, by accident we discovered a workaround that has been consistently working for us (only tested on Xbox).

WORKAROUND: Step 1: Disconnect both controllers and wait for either ""reconnect controller"" prompts. Have player 1 select continue on the prompt for player 2 to reconnect, and visa versa so that both players are now on each others characters.

Step 2: play until the auto save icon appears, we typically use the metro or speak with an npc to trigger this.

Step 3: Disconnect both controllers once more, but this time complete the prompts so that you are now both on your original characters.

Lastly: Have player 2 go to exit the session, and validate that the latest autosave was recent, maybe even trigger another auto save to ensure. Then exit the game.

This has worked for us without fail, and makes couch coop totally viable for this game!

&lt;p&gt;Lastly: Have player 2 go to exit the session, and validate that the latest autosave was recent, maybe even trigger another auto save to ensure. Then exit the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has worked for us without fail, and makes couch coop totally viable for this game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hope this helps other coopers :)&lt;/h1&gt;

"I bought and beat the ascent on PS5 and recently wanted to go back to it on PC. I have a really good PC setup, 4070 ti super and 7800x3d, but I am surprised by performance.

Your 55-60 sounds fine, not sure why you wouldn't want to use dlss, especially when you can swap to the latest version. Use dlss tweaks to set a custom scaling factor to 80% for quality and it'll look better than native, plus you'll remain more GPU bound than if you used the default 67% factor.

"My philosophy is if it works, just stick with it. I used the same automatic rifle pretty much exclusively for the first several hours of the game. The only time I had to go find a new weapon was when mechanical enemies started popping up, specifically the tarantula boss, and the physical rounds just weren’t cutting it. Then a laser cannon was crucial. So now I have both of those that I switch back and forth between, and only upgrade those two. I also rely heavily on the spider drone augmentation and the sentry turret as my tactical weapon. 

But to answer your question, if there’s a specific weapon that you’d like to try to see if it’s better or worse than what you’re already packing, equip it and go to an area you’ve already been with lower level enemies. Then mow a few down and see how you like it.

"It’s nothing like borderlands, except for the fact that it has guns. The game is still pretty good though - it’s not groundbreaking -  but it will definitely leave a good impression.

"It's decent. I bought it on sale a while back, and I enjoyed it enough to clear the main game and just recently pick up the Cyber Heist DLC, which was also on sale.

It's not going in my personal top ten, and it's not the first game I would recommend to someone seeking out a twin-stick shooter they can really sink their teeth into.

The run-and-gun combat is serviceable enough, and it can be fun to mix and match your guns, augments, and tactical equipment to arrive at a build that works for you. In that sense, it's a little bit like a Diablo or a Dark Souls kind of game.

The biggest thing it has going for it is the setting. The Ascent is my favorite depiction of a cyberpunk world in a video game. You can tell the developers poured their hearts and souls into making the arcology both breathtaking to look at and somewhere I would never, ever want to visit.

"If you ask on a Subreddit dedicated to a particular game if the game is for you, you’re almost certain to be fed a bunch of hyperbolic takes. 

Personally, I’m here because I thought the Ascent was a great concept delivered terribly, and live in hope of a sequel that might some day give us The Ascent we deserve. 

Frankly, the game is a mess. It looks gorgeous and the gunplay is satisfying, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t hamstrung by some of the worst technical issues and game design blunders I’ve ever come across.

There are long, long stretches between missions where absolutely nothing is happening. No enemies, no events, just you trudging across a barren, if pretty, landscape looking for people to shoot. You can stave off the loneliness by bringing a friend along but, wherever you play on Xbox, PS4 or PC, you can expect one of many generic or console-specific glitches to disconnect you or cause several other issues that the devs never fixed. 

You may be tempted to explore the open(ish) world, but you’ll encounter several areas that should by all accounts be accessible, only to find yourself locked out by a gameplay contrivance the developers haven’t explained or telegraphed. Sometimes you’ll need to travel to a certain area of the map only to find it inaccessible because you haven’t jumped through the hoops the developer has hidden.

Once you’re in a mission, pray you’ve bought the right weapons with you, because if not, prepare to fight a boss who is only truly susceptible to the weapon type you didn’t take with you. And if you forgot it, prepare to leave the mission, re-equip yourself, and play through it all again, because fuck you.

I wanted and still want The Ascent to be the game I thought it would be. Sadly, rumours that the studio have disbanded have dashed all that hope, and I’m stuck with a game that I wanted to be a new personal favourite languishing in its own filth.  

You may find yourself among some of the people here who can forgive these mistakes - and I totally get that, because the game’s shooting and aesthetics are pretty killer - but for me the game felt like an absolute chore, and I simply gave up on it.

"Here’s what I did. I cheesed it a little but it worked. 

- Travel to the edge and take on the lvl 25 enemies until one drops the enforcer. When that happens, grab it quick. Then sneak across the edge until you get the overwhelmer that’s on a truck. Grab it. If you die after getting the weapon, you keep the weapon. So focus on getting it vs get killed after. 

- Respec your skill points to focus on biometrics and cybernetics (max out health, 8 points to evasion, and the rest of your points to critical hit rate).

- You’ll use the augmentations IO converter (turns all damage to digital for a short time), life transfer, and the rejuv field as your tactical item. Use vital signs booster as your module (reward from the balls deep side mission). 

- Upgrade the overwhelmer and the enforcer. 

- When fighting, use the overwhelmer with the IO converter. When the IO converter is drained, switch to the enforcer, use the life transfer when it’s needed (have to use it when near the spider), and the rejuv field as needed. 

- when eggs are laid by the spider, run to them and hack them. That’ll prevent them from hatching and saves you health/time spent attacking them. 

- Evade, evade, evade. Points in evasion skill will save you. Stay away from the fire by all means. Even go as far as shooting the spider when it’s off screen.

Then went back to the game to try and find them and and there’s no way you can set a way point and it just got so confusing after awhile I just gave up&lt;/p&gt;

I get the waypoint thing but it forces you to explore the whole map ya know? Maybe if they did like an area way point. Like go in this general area to find this. That might work.

"ARPG is a huge genre, but most I've played don't do guns as well as the ascent, if at all.

Twin stick shooter is another part of the game, but many games that do this aren't RPG's at all.

Some recommendations that I have that scratch the gameplay loop, but are not at all RPG's - Hades, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, Yet Another Zombie Survivors, and probably my personal favorite, which - totally recommend if you haven't played it: Aliens: Dark Descent.

The last game is a real time tactics squad based game, so quite a bit different. Has a fully fleshed out story and great combat mechanics and buying gear and stuff but it's in no way an ARPG.

"Hunting for couch co-op games is a weird situation of suffering because it's actually insane how hard they can be to find, and then when you do you can quite immediately run into the problem where they're *only* couch co-op. A discovery I made after splitting with my S.O.

"It's a'ight. I think the enemy variety, even with how short the game is, isn't great. For most of the game you fight the same like 4 dudes really. Bosses are also by far the most disappointing, because they're way too easy and don't really have any new mechanics going on. The final boss being just waved based is probably the most disappointing thing.

Not enough weapons imo. Shotguns and melee weapons are borderline unusable in my experience, *especially* shotguns, where you have to be in the enemy's face for it to actually do good damage, or even decent most of the time. I'm also not the biggest fan of how little upgrade materials you actually find, and the fact that you can't just buy more. It's easy to waste a ton of them, and it's especially annoying when like halfway through the game you get introduced to robot enemies that take less damage from conventional weapons, and are weak to energy ones instead. It also discourages experimenting, because you may find yourself without the upgrade materials to level up the new, shiny weapon.

There's also no reason to do as much backtracking as the game asks of you. In general the amount of time you're going to spend just running around is too much, even *with* fast travel. Sure, the game is pretty, like SUPER pretty (though it could tone down the flashbangs from time to time), but that's not enough when I'm going through the same location for the 5th time.

Quests are also very... Eh. The writing isn't good enough to carry simple fetch or kill quests. The good thing is that there isn't like a hundred of those like Ubisoft games.

Overall it's decent. It's short enough that I don't feel like I wasted my time and the actual feel of the combat is pretty good. Especially fun in co-op. Though it could use some polishing, because I ran into very annoying bugs that forced me to rejoin my friend's game, or the worst by far being the game just freezing. It happened like 5 or 6 times during our playthrough and it was very annoying, I'm surprised it was never, and will probably never going to be addressed.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-12-18T06:24:15.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a&amp;#39;ight.

Shotguns and melee weapons are borderline unusable in my experience, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; shotguns, where you have to be in the enemy&amp;#39;s face for it to actually do good damage, or even decent most of the time. I&amp;#39;m also not the biggest fan of how little upgrade materials you actually find, and the fact that you can&amp;#39;t just buy more. It&amp;#39;s easy to waste a ton of them, and it&amp;#39;s especially annoying when like halfway through the game you get introduced to robot enemies that take less damage from conventional weapons, and are weak to energy ones instead. It also discourages experimenting, because you may find yourself without the upgrade materials to level up the new, shiny weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also no reason to do as much backtracking as the game asks of you. In general the amount of time you&amp;#39;re going to spend just running around is too much, even &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; fast travel. Sure, the game is pretty, like SUPER pretty (though it could tone down the flashbangs from time to time), but that&amp;#39;s not enough when I&amp;#39;m going through the same location for the 5th time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quests are also very... Eh. The writing isn&amp;#39;t good enough to carry simple fetch or kill quests. The good thing is that there isn&amp;#39;t like a hundred of those like Ubisoft games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it&amp;#39;s decent. It&amp;#39;s short enough that I don&amp;#39;t feel like I wasted my time and the actual feel of the combat is pretty good. Especially fun in co-op. Though it could use some polishing, because I ran into very annoying bugs that forced me to rejoin my friend&amp;#39;s game, or the worst by far being the game just freezing. It happened like 5 or 6 times during our playthrough and it was very annoying, I&amp;#39;m surprised it was never, and will probably never going to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

It is great that they got more money and more resources which gives them more freedom to make bigger games. But with new owners I would guess comes new communication protocols.  Too bad they didn't do a sequel to the Ascent.  There were certain sections of the game that was locked in the first game which tells me they were planning a sequel before being bought out.  Would probably cost less to do a sequel since they already built out the world.

Hey there! Absolutely loved this game so I'd hate for you to pack it in from getting stuck. If I remember correctly there's a bit of cover in the upper right hand area of the area you're meant to defend. There's a loot chest nearby I believe and there was a red colored spawn point for the enemies just on the other side of this cover point. From this spot I was able to hold out for a decent amount of time before things got hairy. It's a good idea to have done some side quests and upgraded one the pistols to a decent damage/sec (600-900 maybe by this point?). Pretty sure I used spiderbots to cover my back while I just hammered that spawn hallway. Doesn't hurt to use a health drain aug either. This way - if you're hurting you can just up your health from the absolute havoc you deal out to the combatants.

I just completed this mission oday. Once you've hacked the main terminal head back to where the 3 hallways converge. You can then take out the enemies as they spawn which is far easier than letting them all group together and rush you.

Me and 3 of my friends regularly meet and we started to play The Ascent on Steam. I have created a co-op game session and the first created player is named after my profile name: ""stonegolem"". Other players are names as ""Player 2-3-4"".

Here are my questions:

2) If we continue playing while one of my friends is missing, would his character auto lvl-up to catch ours when he joins later?

1. If you're on fire, roll on the ground to extinguish the flames. (This applies to the real world as well.)
2. You can freely change your equipped weapons without consequences. Changing an augmentation, however, drops your energy level to zero, meaning you cannot readily use the augmentation. Changing your tactical gear has a similar consequence: The new gear starts with zero tactical charges.
3. Don't forget to hack locked chests with your CyberDeck before starting the arduous process of opening them. (Locked chests are gray. The number of yellow lights on them indicates their lock level.)
4. Starting in mid-game, you or your enemies can deploy Rejuv Fields. They are green. Anyone who walks into them (you or your enemies) gets healed. However, your enemies can also deploy a teal Shields Dronette field, which renders anyone who walks into them invincible.
5. The game automatically saves your progress when you enter a new area, after the passing of time, and when you press the Tab key to invoke the journal feature.
6. BUG: As of version 4.26.1.0, the Raphael's Bag quest has two bugs. Don't start this side quest until you've finished the Foreign Code quest. If you first didn't find the bag, exit the game and come back.

"Don't be afraid to spend your weapon upgrade components.

"You have two weapon slots so I like to put different damage types into each.  That way if ballistics are good against human enemies, but then a big mech appears I can switch to an energy weapon for better damage against it.

I liked the Dominator on my first run - decent damage and a big magazine to keep firing.

There's a ballistic/physical damage version and an energy damage version, giving effective options against most types of enemies.

I did get the flamethrower but saw it as a bit of a novelty weapon rather than a serious option.

Fun to mess about with though I didn&amp;#39;t take it into any high enemy level areas to see how well I&amp;#39;d survive with that as a primary weapon.  Maybe okay on some indoor / close quarters fighting, but you are vulnerable if there are longer range enemies able to shoot back.&lt;/p&gt;

"EBR Enforcer was my choice for energy weapons.

First playthrough I got this killing some higher level enemies over in The Edge.  The Grinder transit station (low level area) is right next to The Edge (high level area).  By carefully crossing the bridges I was able to get one or two enemies at a time to focus on and kill and hope they dropped one.  Risky when you are lower level than them, but dying has little consequence there so worth a few attempts.

Second playthrough I maybe got lucky with drops but got one much earlier.  It was a sidequest started in the Morgue in Cluster 13 - Bubble Trouble.  Once over in Nitroad you go inside some facility, do what was needed, then trying to leave some higher level mercs get sent in to kill you.  One of those dropped this rifle.

"I'm not aware of such a bug.  The component count should increase by one for each you find, and decrease when you spend them at the weapon upgrade character back in town.

All weapons use the same pool of components to upgrade, so providing you have enough of the required tier of components you should be able to spend them.  Only thing that comes to mind if it shows 0 available for a weapon might be if you had already upgraded a weapon to either Mk5 or Mk8 and the next upgrade required a higher tier of components which you were out of?

"I bought this game blindly during the Steam sale, and 20 days/36 hours later I finished my first solo hard play through.

What a ton of fun this game is, and what a shame that development came to a halt. There is so much potential for more that I hope a mod team takes the reins on; It'd be really cool to see PvP or an endless/survival mode added into the game.

I spent some time after beating the main/side quests just achievement hunting. Coop achievements were done via couch coop mode with a second controller. Also it took forever to find that level 35 bounty and farm 50+ deaths...

Overall I'd say it was definitely worth picking up the game. Story was rich, solo gameplay was fun but kinda wish I got some real coop experience, and the visuals... who'd have thought an isometric shooter could look this good?

Story was rich, solo gameplay was fun but kinda wish I got some real coop experience, and the visuals... who&amp;#39;d have thought an isometric shooter could look this good? Crashes/deadlocks were few and far between, I think only 4-5 times total, and they usually happened when I was ready to log off for the night anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/5 would play again!&lt;/p&gt;

Hey everyone,

I've been diving deep into The Ascent on PS4 lately and am absolutely loving it! However, I think everything's better with friends, so I'm looking for some fellow players to join me in co-op adventures.

If you're up for some action-packed sessions, exploring the neon-lit world of Veles together, and taking on challenging missions, hit me up! Drop your PSN ID in the comments or send me a DM, and let's coordinate some gaming sessions.

"Hey I'm currently stuck at the main mission named in the title. It's where you have to go through the door to reach ""menshin"" or what it's called and you have to the door for like 3 minutes or something but i just can't to it. I do have the abr commander, ebr enforcer, rpg23, overwhelmer, dismemberer and recoil at mk8,  some other weapons at mk 5 and some a bit lower even. What of these weapons should I upgrade to 9 or even 10? And which weapon would you recommend for this mission? And also which tactical should I use? Normally I have the healing field thingy, bit in this fight it just gets destroyed almost immediately so I switched to the pocket mech, but I still can't manage to get it. It always that I die in the last 30 seconds or so. Do you guys have any helpful tips or anything? I tried like 15 times or so and still just get fucked by these shitty fucking enemies and its starting to frustrate me. I was thinking of getting the overwhwelmer to 10, what else would you recommend? And what is the best rocket launcher in your opinion? I was quite happy so far with the rpg23, but there are to modified versions of it available, the blastmaster and the one which name I forgot, I think it's basically the same but with a drum mag. Are they Worth getting and leveling up instead? I'm really out of ideas but also don't wanna waste the components for mk9 and 10, as they are so limited.

"This is one of the tougher missions, like the megarachnoid boss. My advice would be to use the rejuv field, spiderbots, and i/o converter (or Life transfer). When low on health use the spiderbots for coverage and then use the rejuv field so it’s not taken out so soon. The I/o converter will give you the best cover for bots while even using the overwhelmer, but the enforcer should be enough to use too, so life transfer is an option to keep you alive while fighting in the open if I/o converter isn’t up to par for your needs. Consider switching armor to focus on kinetic and fire resistance. I doubt enemies would use energy/digital damage on you.

"I can’t imagine why Krafton would acquire Neon Giant and then simply do nothing with this material. There’s such a rich game environment waiting to be fully built out, and solid foundations of so many story and lore elements already in place, the world of The Ascent seems to be an ideal candidate for extensive expansion. Guns, armour, augs, enemies, locations, corps, history…it’s all there.
And there’s no reason that a sequel would need to employ the same isometric view gameplay or be a twin-stick shooter (as much as I love how fun this is) - IMO this is just screaming to be developed into a full-blown 1st or 3rd person perspective RPG.
I can’t help but think of how the original Grand Theft Auto game (top-down view) was developed into full open world. I wonder if Krafton were maybe waiting for CP2077 to cool down before progressing further?

"I think you are on the right track with CP2077.  As awesome as The Ascent is, it would be in direct competition and so returns on such a project might be sub-optimal in the near future.  

What I would do in the meantime, is create a series of low-cost comics or short graphic novels set in the world of the Ascent to keep the IP active for fans and draw in new attention.  The point of these being to flesh out the setting with quality writing and development on a relatively low budget.  

If they actually make a graphic novel, it should probably contain a one-time QR code or something for a discount in the game.

I also have been on the hunt for a Sci-fi D2 inspired game. I was hoping the first Helldivers was it when I first played it years ago, but it’s not. Once I accepted that though, I had a good time figuring it out. Inquisitor is a good recommendation for sure, but I’d also check out Neon Chrome if you want to scratch that itch. It’s more Rouge Lite than Arpg, but its twin stick mechanics, story, and progression system are all solid, making it well worth the asking price and it’s often on sale. 10 Tons is the dev/pub and I’ve been begging them for years to make a NC sequel with more Diablo like items, skill trees, and the like.

"Tried it with my wife last week. Was terrible having to run around doing quest. You could be outlevel and running and rolling for minutes to get to destination just to kill a few lower level enemy then run all the way back to return quest. Even though there's fast travel (taxi) it is so poorly design we had no clue what the location name mean at all or what is closest to our quest.
And yes it's extremely buggy to the point it's unplayable. Lots of crashes, black screen, map ui stuck on screen, can't move, alot of restarting over.

Was terrible having to run around doing quest. You could be outlevel and running and rolling for minutes to get to destination just to kill a few lower level enemy then run all the way back to return quest. Even though there&amp;#39;s fast travel (taxi) it is so poorly design we had no clue what the location name mean at all or what is closest to our quest.
And yes it&amp;#39;s extremely buggy to the point it&amp;#39;s unplayable. Lots of crashes, black screen, map ui stuck on screen, can&amp;#39;t move, alot of restarting over.

"Really...? What has got you so impressed?  
I just finished the main story and will be playing through the DLC next week. And while I think The Ascent is entertaining enough for a few bucks on sale, I thought it was very mediocre in many places.  
The game is still quite buggy even after such a long time after release (quest triggers not working, dodging getting you stuck in terrain, hit detection, occasional crashes).  
I found the AI companion dialogue extremely cringeworthy and the story somewhat unimaginative, seeing as there was zero attempt to build up an antagonist throughout the story and the final boss ended up being a retread of the 'the portal just opens up to a tentacle monster' gotcha that Borderlands 1 already did a decade ago.

In regards to world building, I much preferred the more grounded Cyberpunk 2077 setting, which is closer to the setting in Neuromancer and the Sprawl trilogy that got me into the genre in the first place. The Ascents world has more in common with Mass Effect than Blade Runner.

Edit: From an ARPG perspective the game was also a major disappointment. I have no idea why some people call this an ARPG when it doesn't even have randomized loot.

"If you're at the point where you have a MK8 Overwhelmer and like that playstyle I'd try to get the two Battle Rifles and see how you like those - also Machine guns but with homing bullets.

The ABR Commander (ballistic) is locked inside a crate in Cluster 13 - you just need high enough cyberdeck to unlock it.

The EBR Enforcer (energy) can most commonly be found dropped by enemies in The Edge.  However on my recent playthrough I think I got super lucky with perhaps a random drop while on the morgue side quest, so I had this before a certain large spider making that much easier.

Generally I found new weapons dropped from enemies before they came up for purchase in the shops, so didn't really have much to spend money on.

Similar for armour.  If it has a number in the name (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60) then generally the higher number indicates a higher tier of equipment.

I found one vendor who only sold one weapon I've heard some people talking was good so I bought it, the desintegrator. Any thoughts on that?

"haha no worries.

It's generally good to have two different weapons equipped with different damage types so you can easily switch between them as the need arises.  I liked the battle rifles, so had them in each slot and flipped between ballistic and energy depending on the enemy, while the homing bullets made sure they found their mark.  One key difference with those was it freed up skill points - I put 0 in aiming or weapon handling since the guns did that job pretty well.  Using other guns those would be needed.

The Ascent has a few unique weapons - the flamethrower can be fun, which I purchased because it was available from that one guy, though didn't end up using it all that much.  good for a laugh.

The minigun can be fun dealing a lot of damage, but it slows your movement to a crawl.  You deal a lot of damage but also get hit more while doing it.    The strikebreaker definitely drops - there were some oversized enemies in I think corpzone that could have them.

The wiki has stats on each weapon for things like damage, but I like to try them out against enemies for a bit to see how well they seem to work, certainly before dumping a ton of upgrades into them.  Mk1-5 are potentially limitless since they drop from bounties.  Mk6-8 are a bit rarer, but certain larger enemies can drop these, so potentially be farmed to upgrade all the weapons you want.  The rarest components for Mk9-10 you will want to hold back for your final choices of weapons since these are very limited (glitch late game lets you farm this, or the DLC adds more).

I think the Dealbreaker will be a fun weapon for you - not available to purchase and must be found late in the game, but is a combined automatic minigun / shotgun hybrid weapon.  Spins up like a minigun, damages like a shotgun.  Just bring along enough upgrade points to max it out and have a blast.

Armour bonuses aren't immediately obvious depending what they buff.  While my character skill points remained the same I did notice some armour would buff my HP or energy meter, but it was less clear for buffs to stablity or evasion - hard to judge any change.  So I looked both at whether the armour seemed best in slot (helmet / chest / legs) and then were they overall balanced with each other - have I ended up with a lot of fire protection when really I want more ballistic?  Armour is something that will change fairly regularly as you progress through the zones so I didn't get too caught up in swapping pieces around until you have a selection of purple pieces to pick from.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-05-13T09:04:36.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;haha no worries.&lt;/p&gt;

"But isn't weapon handling how fast you reload and switch weapons? I thought this might be useful even with homing bullets.

"The BR in ABR and EBR stands for Battle Rifle, so collectively those two as Battle Rifles.

Reloading comes in handy for weapons with small magazines or long reload times.  The two BR's had decent sized clips and good damage, so for a lot of encounters I'd kill a small group and not have reloading as an issue.  Later on I had points to spare and you do get benefit from a few points in a skill, but it wasn't one I was going to invest much in.

Swapping weapons also useful, but it's shaving a fraction of a second off something I don't need to do in many brief battles.

Skills I focused on Crit Chance to do more damage.  Tactical charge to be able to use abilities more often. Vitality helps survivability.  Body battery not initially used a lot, but later when you have points to spare is nice to increase and use your other traits more.  while you can kill everything easily with just guns not a high priority.

I know the title of the post is how do I spend credits - I finished the game with over 1m credits remaining, owned every weapon, every armour, including the odd stuff I didn't think I'd ever use just because I could.  I think the only really expensive thing was using respec at the doctor to reallocate skill points.

Interruptor I don't recognise - perhaps a DLC weapon?

for weapon upgrade parts, first make sure to find every chest marked on the map. Some contain weapon upgrades, some cyberdeck upgrades, some weapons.  After that random bounties are the main source of basic components.  It costs 1,2,3,4,5 to get through Mk1-5, then 1,2,3 of the mid-level components for Mk6-8, then 1,2 of the superior components for Mk 9-10.

If you need to get from one area to another the train or taxi can be the fastest, but running between zones may run into the occasional bounty so you collect them that way.

A more ordered place to do a bit of weapon upgrade farming is at Scrapland.  You descend down to that level via a lift and enemies spawn.  There are I think 3 locations down there where tougher enemies spawn and can drop both common and advanced components. If you then return to the upper level, then back down in the lift you can run the area again.

I didn't spend much time with the RPGs.  I think you get the Astrosmasher following the main quest which fired missiles/grenades faster the longer you held the trigger.  I think the Beseiger and RPG23 were similar but perhaps the upgraded version.

In a lot of games I like using sniper rifles, but I didn't really get along with them in this - the restriction to camera angles, not being able to look in the direction you want to shoot, while getting shot at from pretty close range just off screen made those a bit trickier to use.  Homing bullets were just too easy an option to pass up :-)",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-05-13T10:36:58.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BR in ABR and EBR stands for Battle Rifle, so collectively those two as Battle Rifles.&lt;/p&gt;

"Is the mission Trace Protocol, inside a lab near corpzone, fighting an Ascender in a mech suit?

From memory it was a few waves of regular enemies, then the lady in the mech suit near the end.

If your two weapons are the two battle rifles with homing bullets (ABR Commander and EBR Enforcer) then those at Mk9 are great.  I did much of that section of the game using primarily the EBR regardless of enemy type.

Enemies seem to take it in turns which side they approach from, so check the mini map and focus on taking each group out as fast as possible.  Try to put some hard object between you and them, staying crouched behind it and firing over the top to minimise the damage you take during this phase of the fight.

I had Mono Ranger as one of my options which both provides another source of damage and attracts some of the enemy attention.  If you are struggling with health then the rejuv field might be a handy one to take.

Once the mech comes in to play you need to keep moving and watch for what attacks it is doing.  A few hit a wide area but it gets marked on the floor shortly before it hits.  Make use of dodge / roll to quickly move out of the way minimising damage.  Your homing bullets mean you just keep firing in the vaguely right direction and they should do some damage.

You do have the option to respec your character skill points back in Cluster 13 though it costs more credits the more points you have spent.  Don't know what you've put your points in to, so it might be good already.

If you are using the battle rifles with homing bullets you don't have much need for aiming - the guns do it automatically.  Put more into Crit Hit rate (more damage), Vitality will give you more survivability, Evasion to dodge attacks and Tactical Sense to use your other abilities more frequently in combat.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-05-16T20:07:07.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the mission Trace Protocol, inside a lab near corpzone, fighting an Ascender in a mech suit?&lt;/p&gt;

"The megarachnoid is one of the first big challenges in the game and a frequent place for players to get stuck depending on their build and playstyle.  
  
While energy and digital are preferable damage types against robots, if you've not been levelling those weapons, or only just found them, then your ballistic weapons may still do more damage. Make use of upgrading weapons when you are in Cluster 13 as increasing it even from Mk1 to Mk5 with basic components can make a big difference to damage.  
  
Try to keep your distance from the spider so the flamethrower attack can't reach you. It will follow you around the room, so try to drag it towards one end, then as it gets too close use the roll ability to get past it and run back towards the other end of the room.  
  
Remember you have hacking as an ability. When it deploys eggs you can hack those to prevent them from hatching and fewer things to worry about. You can also shoot them to make them explode.  
  
Use your grenade and other abilities, not just your guns.  
  
In the run up to that room I think you find Mono Ranger. I found this useful in this fight for two reasons. It spawns a robot on your side which starts shooting nearby enemies. But it also provides another target for enemies to focus on. Deploy it and have it between you and the spider and it can draw the fire and damage, while you continue to shoot the spider.  
  
If you still have unspent character skill points a few skills are useful. Vitality gives you more HP for survivability. Crit Chance for more shots to do criticals (more damage). Tactical Charge for more frequent use of your tactical ability.

"Sorry to Necro but I was looking for the same advice a few days ago so maybe this will be helpful for posterity sake ---



I just finished the game and wanna say to all the peeps saying IO converter you get that after this boss so that's not a helpful tip. You can hack the egg thingies and using an energy weapon (one should drop before the boss) will damage it more than ballistic. If you can do the bubble trouble side quest (https://theascent.wiki.fextralife.com/Bubble+Trouble) and get the biometric timestamp that allows for healing. I'm pretty sure that side quest can be done before doing the bossfight/main mission though it may be a few levels over where you should be so you might need to grind a level or two/do some other side stuff. Stasis would probably work if you have access to that for splash damage to get rid of the mini-spiders though I don't personally like stasis and didn't use it to get thru the fight.

I like a good challenge but the arena for fighting this boss was absolutely not thought out well at all. ZERO cover, not a single obstacle to kite the boss AND arming it with a flame thrower. I died multiple times on EASY also.

The game itself is quite janky and filled with bugs but it has a certain charm. Based on the number of posts about this boss fight the developers could have tweaked the arena in a patch or nerfed the flame thrower.

My character was also built for high damage and my lower vitality was a huge problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like a good challenge but the arena for fighting this boss was absolutely not thought out well at all. ZERO cover, not a single obstacle to kite the boss AND arming it with a flame thrower. I died multiple times on EASY also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game itself is quite janky and filled with bugs but it has a certain charm. Based on the number of posts about this boss fight the developers could have tweaked the arena in a patch or nerfed the flame thrower.&lt;/p&gt;

"Don't worry.  While you can't reset spent weapon upgrades, you can dig yourself out of the hole.

There are 3 types of components to upgrade weapons: Basic, Advanced and Superior.

Look at the game map for chests.  Opening these may drop a Basic or Advanced component, so you have targets to aim for.

But you will also come across randomly spawning named enemies who have a Bounty on them.  Kill them and they should also drop a Basic component.  For this reason there are potentially enough Basic components to upgrade every weapon in the game, if you are prepared to grind a lot of Bounties.

Later on you will encounter some enemies who even drop Advanced components, so with enough grinding you can level the weapons you want up to Mk8.

The only truly limited components are the Superior ones.  If you play the base game the way the devs intended you can find enough to max out 2 guns, so make sure you choose wisely.

"I don't have the Cyber Heist DLC, which I believe becomes available at the end of the main game and should make more superior components available.

I was about L30 at the end of the main game and had enough basic components to get most weapons I wanted to try out to Mk5, the good ones to Mk8 and because it was my second playthrough I did take advantage of the late game glitch to max out a few more.

My weapons of choice were the two Battle Rifles since they have homing bullets, decent damage and large clips.  There is a ballistic version ABR Commander, and energy version EBR Enforcer.  Due to homing bullets I didn't put any points into Aiming nor Weapon Handling, letting me max out the other skills.

Having two weapons with different damage types (ballistic, energy, fire, digital) can be handy when exploring new areas as some enemies are more vulnerable to one type than another.

There's a few ""excessive weapons"" which can be fun to play with - sounds like you have the Astrosmasher.  There are a couple of miniguns (Strikebreaker and Strobos) which can be fun to use, though slow to move with.  The Dealbreaker is also a very popular late game weapon - a sort of cross between a minigun and a shotgun.  At least with the DLC you have more time to enjoy that weapon.

For armour, if it contains a number in the name (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60) higher is normally better.  Have a look at the stats, compare the two.  Some will buff your skills a bit, so if two are similar protection but one also boosts your health or damage go for that.  Near the end you want to be on all purple equipment.

You can always visit one of the vendors in town to change your cosmetic appearance if you like the look of one type of armour but prefer the stats of another.

I do like the way the game lets you apply any upgrades you bought to any version of that weapon you find, so visit a vendor, hit the button to sell all duplicates, then back to playing.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-05-04T17:39:03.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the Cyber Heist DLC, which I believe becomes available at the end of the main game and should make more superior components available.&lt;/p&gt;

There wasn't much trick. Use the consoles as cover when you can but also keep moving and changing cover because of ferals and other mobs spawning. The tentacles weren't an issue.

I use life transfer when it gets a bit dangerous, and with tactical and critical hit being pretty much maxed. Life transfer has a pretty big area.

"Yes it is possible to backtrack, all the way to Cluster 13 if you need to, and you shouldn't need to fight anything harder on the way out than what you already killed going in.

The megarachnoid is one of the first big challenges in the game and a frequent place for players to get stuck depending on their build and playstyle.

While energy and digital are preferable damage types against robots, if you've not been levelling those weapons, or only just found them, then your ballistic weapons may still do more damage.  Make use of upgrading weapons when you are in Cluster 13 as increasing it even from Mk1 to Mk5 with basic components can make a big difference to damage.

Try to keep your distance from the spider so the flamethrower attack can't reach you.  It will follow you around the room, so try to drag it towards one end, then as it gets too close use the roll ability to get past it and run back towards the other end of the room.

Remember you have hacking as an ability. When it deploys eggs you can hack those to prevent them from hatching and fewer things to worry about.  You can also shoot them to make them explode.

Use your grenade and other abilities, not just your guns.

In the run up to that room I think you find Mono Ranger. I found this useful in this fight for two reasons.  It spawns a robot on your side which starts shooting nearby enemies.  But it also provides another target for enemies to focus on.  Deploy it and have it between you and the spider and it can draw the fire and damage, while you continue to shoot the spider.

If you still have unspent character skill points a few skills are useful.  Vitality gives you more HP for survivability.  Crit Chance for more shots to do criticals (more damage).  Tactical Charge for more frequent use of your tactical ability.

"The game does autosave at various points, as you enter certain areas, so if you die you respawn back at that place, though normally those should be relatively safe places.  Guess not in this instance.

If it's during the first mission I don't recall there being anything particularly dangerous so it's possibly just a matter of control and getting out of your current position.

Keep moving.  Pick a direction, perhaps towards an area that was cleared and run towards it.  If enemies keep spawning around you this will draw them out into a line chasing you - easier to keep shooting at them and thinning them out.

Use roll to dodge enemies and damage.  This moves you a short distance and you shouldn't take (much) damage while doing it.

If you have any additional skills use them - grenade or hydraulic slam are things you might have found.

I doubt you've even reached the point where you can upgrade weapons, so use what you have.  If there are lots of enemies I'd probably favour the gun with the bigger clip, though you're probably picking between only 2 or 3 guns at this point.

I don't think the first mission lets you get into an area with much higher level enemies than you, but if you see enemies with a skull icon above their heads (indicating they are at least 5 levels higher than you) it's better to just run away until you are confident in how to play.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-04-13T19:42:22.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game does autosave at various points, as you enter certain areas, so if you die you respawn back at that place, though normally those should be relatively safe places.

"I feel This game really could use some post game support.(or more delays before release to begin with) 

Bad map. 

Coop buggy af with constant freezes. Eventually we gave up after a freeze every 10-20 min and played solo in party. (Can only speak for ps5) 

No public matchmaking. (This one really hurt the game and because of that the sales imo)

Strange fast travel and long loading times. 
When u want to go to a different zone u have to take taxi to the beginning of the zone ur in and after that take the elevator. Seems strange amd unnecessary making u go trough 2 long loading times. 

This is all i can think of right now im
Sure there is more so feel free to add. 

I know this game is made for ps4 with ps4 in mind. 

But they released dlc even tough the game has issues since day 1. (Game breaking issues like coop) 

Fix the coop and this game would be a legendary masterpiece but oh well.

"Check you are using one of your better weapons and not something you found very early game.

Spend some of the upgrade parts you've been accumulating on your preferred weapons.  Mk1-5 can be bought with common components which can be farmed endlessly with the bounties.  Even just using those parts can really improve the damage.

The uncommon tier 2 parts are less common, but can also be farmed late game for as many as you want.  It is only the rarest tier 3 parts you really want to be selective with which weapons you upgrade - I think you can max out 3 or 4 weapons to Mk10 in one playthrough without abusing a glitch.

Different weapons suit different playstyles, but I really enjoyed the two battle rifles with homing projectiles, which if you've beaten megarachnoid should be available in some zones.

For the defend in place type encounters make use of cover where you can and fire over it.  Enemies approach from some distance and you can take out multiple enemies before they can reach an angle to shoot you back.

Make use of your augments and grenade slot.  Mono Ranger and turret help provide additional damage while also distracting the enemy with other targets.  Joyrun dragon can freeze (and then explode) a string of enemies.  Even the basic slam can knock enemies back.  Roll or diagonal dash can help you dodge incoming damage or get out from being overrun.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-04-03T01:19:33.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check you are using one of your better weapons and not something you found very early game.&lt;/p&gt;

"You gain 3 skill points per level, plus you can find some in the world - look on the map for the crate icons.  Crate icons can contain a skill point, a cyberdeck upgrade or more commonly weapon upgrade components.

If you see a crate icon on the map it is worth trying to collect, though know that just because an icon is nearby doesn't always mean you can reach it yet, and it may be guarded by enemies that are significantly higher level than those close by.  A quirk of how they designed the maps.

To spend skill points go into your character menu and where it lists your 8 skills you pick which ones to put points into.  Each goes up to 20 and while technically you can keep levelling and max them all out, especially with NG+, if you do all missions and side quests in one playthrough you can expect to reach about L30.

Early game you can experiment with the different weapons and skills to see what playstyle suits you.  As you progress you will find more and better weapons.  If you don't like your skills you can visit a few merchants who can reset them for a fee.

Crit Rate and Tactical Charge will be useful for just about any build.  More crits = more damage = faster kills. Tactical Charge means you will be able to deploy your skills more frequently

Some points into Vital Signs will help boost your health, while Evasion will help with dodging some incoming damage.

Body Battery will become useful, but something to invest into later in the game.

&lt;p&gt;Weapon Handling and Aim will be useful for a lot of builds, but there are some weapons with homing bullets that make these skills redundant - so very much down to your playstyle.&lt;/p&gt;

"Only recommendation I could make for using the shotgun is upgrade health, dash, and reload speed. you’re more often gonna be in your opponents face. It’s not too hard to max your health early on and it could make the difference with the extra rounds you’re gonna take while closing the gap but also super helpful regardless what kind of build  you want since it increases your room for error while you’re trying to learn the different enemies. After that look into increasing your dash ability so you can avoid taking those extra rounds in the first place. The more upgraded it is plus adding equipment that boosts it you can just dash all over the screen nonstop essentially. And reload speed cuz it would suck to eat a couple rounds just to show up with an empty mag lol. 

Whatever skills you decide to boost, find a combination of augs that work for your playstyle and ideally match up with the skills you decide to boost.

"Haha - first time I played it took me several attempts to beat it.  Replayed it recently and beat it first time - knowing more about the game certainly helped.

Having an energy weapon is more effective against mechanicals than conventional bullets, but you can still go brute force with conventional weapons.  You should have found the energy rifle in the rooms leading up to that, though possibly only Mk1 without upgrade components spent on it.

Alternatively the Dominator HMG I found quite effective, though really helps if you have spent upgrade points on it.  Look for the loot boxes on the mini map as you explore as many contain these components.

For other equipment I think the Mono Ranger should drop in the rooms leading up to that, and I also like the deployable turret (grenade slot).  Both provide additional damage as well as a distraction for the enemy to target instead of you.

Deploy those to take hits while you stand back and pour fire onto the main spider.  Shooting the eggs can also help reduce getting overwhelmed with the smaller spiders.  Try to draw it to where you want it before needing to use dodge/roll to get past it while your powers recharge.

On my more recent playthrough I maybe got lucky with loot drops as I got the EBR (energy rifle with homing bullets) during the side quest Bubble Trouble in Nitroad.  That makes things MUCH easier, as it is a better damage type against this enemy, plus the bullets home in on their target.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-04-01T20:55:58.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haha - first time I played it took me several attempts to beat it.

"The way I did it was to first sneak my way into the edge and grab the overwhelmer. Took a few tries but got it. Then went about killing those lvl 25 guys until an enforcer dropped.

I bought that along with Morrowind and Oblivion. Keys delivered in a few minutes, one per game so you can split them if you want, and redeemed fine on Steam.  I may be back at the start, without my endgame gear, but it's fun to start over and experience it again.

OP is essentially getting it super sampled. The remote server is running at 1440p and then his display is rendering that out to 1080, or whatever the ROG Ally runs at. It should appear slightly more crisp than running it natively at 1080p. 

Sometimes YouTube creators will do something like this. They record and render out videos to 4k, then after the video is uploaded and compressed, the 1080p or 1440p versions will look better than a video that was uploaded and rendered in 1080p, then watched at 1080p.

Shader's are programs games use to determine how things are displayed. For example, pixel shaders would determine a pixel's color, design, reflectiveness, etc. 

A shader cache remembers the results of these programs and calculations, after it's been done. This speeds up the loading speed in games, since it doesn't need to manually recalculate how the same thing each time..it just references what the result in it's memory (or cache). 

&amp;#x200B;

The Steam Deck is many things, but powerful isn't one of them. The graphics card is limited, and when you're first loading a game immediately after downloading it...there's a lot of slow downs, skips, and even crashes. This goes away, and you see a performance improve after playing for a bit, as the game has built up a cache remembering how things load. 

The Steam Deck even downloads these cache's to games you have installed, proactively. This is why you'll constantly see the deck with a list of nightly downloads. 

  
So the first time you are booting up a game you just downloaded on the Steam Deck, you have some performance issues as it's trying to build that shader cache on the fly, which it just isn't that good at.   


If you're not seeing any improvements in performance after a while, there could be other compatability issues at play.",,theascent,r/theascent,2024-01-28T10:34:26.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure I can ELI5, I&amp;#39;m not a technical expert and only have cursory understanding.

Yes, the game works like a dream on Steam Deck with one caveat... DO NOT TURN ON DIRECTX12 OR ACTIVATE ANY DIRECTX12 SETTINGS!

When graphics are too high, it doesn't just slow down, it crashes. This is the only game that had ever crashed my deck! And once directx12 effects are on, you can't turn them without reinstalling! The main menu has a fully rendered 3d background, so it cant even handle the menu and crashes before you can even get to the settings. Really annoying when you're trying to play with the settings to find the best balance.

"Genuinely a great game. Lots of fun, surprisingly deep tactically, decent story and a LOT to explore.

LV up grants stat points which can be invested in 8 stats (such as accuracy, crit rate, health etc). I believe LV also affects core characteristics such as damage. The 8 stats are paired into categories which raise a core attribute - attributes modify the effects of certain augmentations as well as the look of your character.

Your character starts out looking somewhat normal and is a total chromed up cyber-badass by the time they’ve levelled up towards the end of your first playthrough.

There isn’t a skill tree/perks but you can install 2x augmentations (powers) and 2x mods (passive bonuses). These can be swapped out at your preference.

There aren’t weapon mods, just levelling. Equipment all has “grading” colour codes from white (1-5), yellow (5-7), gold (8-9), purple (10). Armor and cybers (grenades) cannot be regraded and come in preset types, weapons all start at 1 and can be improved by using parts that you collect around the game world. Weapons also break into about 5 main categories which are something like: sidearms, rifles, overkill, sniper, melee. I think there’s 30+ weapons and there’s no inventory penalty so you can carry them all (although you can only actively equip 2)


Or to put it another way:
- your character levels up and you invest skills to change play (this can be respec’d if you want)
- you can actively “hold” 2 weapons, switching between them. Weapons start at level 1 and can be upgraded to level 10
- you can wear head, body and leg armor, which is a preset level depending on the kit and affects how you look
- you can equip a grenade type weapon, and there’s 10+ ranging from grenades to drones to a full on robotic armor
- you can equip 2 “augments” (active powers) and there are a bunch to choose from that you find as you progress
- you can equip 2 “mods” (passive powers) - I’ve only found 3 so far but there may be more",,theascent,r/theascent,2023-12-05T10:28:44.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genuinely a great game. Lots of fun, surprisingly deep tactically, decent story and a LOT to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

"Well, you're in luck. I have a Christmas present for you. I found a way to fix it. Tested, Tried, and True: I had a theory, and it hasn't crashed since I implemented that theory because I have been fixing electronics for my friends and myself since I was young, and that included games that like to screw up. I just needed to think a little bit, and BOOM, fixed. I hope it works for everyone who loves this game as much as I do.
So after you have the game again, do this:
Instructions
1. Turn on the game, and as soon as it loads up and the intro is done, hit the options button on the PS4 control and go to settings. Once in settings, go to Graphics and turn off
Motion Blur
Film Grain
and then go play the game all you want. Sometimes you still have to rebuild the data base of the PS4 Pro first after the game is installed. Then just turn off what I said, and you're good to go.
Test it if you don't believe me. I had numerous crashes. I almost got  Pist enough to uninstall myself, but I took a deep breath and I said, Humm, what could be doing this? Lo and behold, that's what it was. The thing that pisses most people off is often the most simple thing to fix.
Oh, and if it works for you, spread this Far and wide because I know there are a bunch of people who really want to Love this game.

"I played it with a friend on his PS4 multiple times. It crashed around 30-40 minutes in every time we played. I still decided to buy it on PC, played around 4-5 hours (single player), and now it's doing the same thing, crashing every 30 minutes. It's definitely not a specs issue. I just bought this desktop and play pretty much every game on ultra (i7, 32 GB RAM, and RTX 4070).

It's really frustrating on PC because when it crashes, I'm stuck on a black screen. I can't minimize it and task manager won't open over the black screen, so I have to logout or restart my computer. I really love the world and aesthetic of the game, but if it's crashing on PS4 *and* a PC with specs like this, I would consider the game completely unplayable.

"Just ran into a serious couch co-op issue on ps5. My son and I are playing together, he is hosting and I’m the 2nd player. We ended our 4th or 5th session about 4 days ago. Booted back up tonight and all of my progress from the last session was gone, I was level 17 and he was level 19. I lost weapons, augs, cyberdeck upgrades, everything from the last session. I checked my save file on the ps5 under my account and it was from a few hours before we had ended the session, so it never saved properly for me as the 2nd player. But it did for him as the host. 

So we played again tonight for a few hours and I check my save file again with the game paused before quitting. Again, save file never updated for me.

We just reached Pinnacle tonight and he’s level 20 now, but I’ll be back on level 17 stuck there again.

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how far from the end we are, but if we can’t beat the game in one long session next time, we might just have to quit playing this game. It sucks that this game has been out for a few years and is this seriously broken! Is Neon Giant going to fix it?!&lt;/p&gt;

"Yeah, the game is a CPU hog, especially in areas where there's a lot of NPC interaction. I'm totally CPU bottlenecked, but that's a bit expected since I'm only using i7 8700K.

I get about 60fps on average out in the open at 4K with all the raytracing cranked up and using DLS quality, but that drops to around 45-47 fps in Cluster 13 where all the shops are at.

"I've been trying to see whether enemies are worth fighting and checking out the XP I get from them, and came to a conclusion that one doesn't get XP from those ""skull"" enemies. Balance reasons, all right then. Then later I noticed that I'm not getting any XP from some of the enemies closer to my own level either, and after a bit of researching, I figured out that letting the enemies die from DoT like burning doesn't give any experience points. Is this somehow intentional? Killing with physical damage gives the XP, but with something like fire damage doesn't. Did I just waste my components to upgrade my fire pistol thingy? 

Also I don't really get the point of activating those turrets because you don't get any XP from enemies they kill either. I'd understand this better, but it kinda takes away the reason to and fun of hacking those things in the first place, when I don't need the help and they just rob me the XP I'd much rather have.

Is the game working as intended or is it bugging? Any way, I don't feel it makes too much sense to use anything else but your own physical damage weapons to kill things, though I'm not too far into the game so I could tell if it affects anything else but the fire damage and turrets.

"This guy took me a few tries the first time around for sure.

What I did was used an upgraded dominator, and kept kiting the bastard and rolling around a lot and trying to shoot the little spiders at a distance. And even if it took awhile and I was picking my spots to do damage, it worked. That was my first playthrough, Ps4 version.

2nd playthrough on ps5 I used combinations of the dominator, the neutron beam, and the robot guy with the rifle you can summon on your side (in order to draw the spiders somewhere other than me mainly, not to do damage.)

I will admit, I play on medium. But on PS4, I switched to easy after like 5-10 tries, but back to medium after I finally got it.

The main thing with this or any boss is do not let them damage you. Learn how to kite them and pick your spots.

"I just 100% it including DLC and Platinum trophy. 
The game is 10 times more fun in co-op mode with a friend or two.  
Current version is in pretty good shape. Only bugs I encountered were during co-op online mode. My mate kept dropping out or getting a black screen, stuck in the menu etc. I’d say it happened at least once per gaming session in online co-op only.

We really enjoyed and appreciated the cyberpunk-esque artistic style, cool object physics and lighting. Gameplay is fun too with lots of “say hello to my little friend” moments. Plenty of augmentations and tactical so buff you up.

Towards the end it got a bit repetitive with the side quests. We just used the taxi like 1000 times to get around. (Left D-Pad button)

The map… oh lord.. is the shittest designed map I’ve ever seen. You can’t mark a waypoint, you can’t tell where the fuck you are or where you should go, multiple levels scrolling, fuck that.

Thank fuck they had a (up D pad) ping system to mark the way to the next mission. You can easily get lost in pretty much everywhere you go without it.

As for the lore… don’t expect much just enjoy the game. Typical futuristic dystopian script where you are “contractor” running errands for people and collecting moneys and loot to upgrade your character. Although I noticed a lot of the lore is hidden behind random NPC dialogue and data pads. So slow down and check those if you want more lore details.

Music, was great! If you’re into electronic. 

Overall for me a 7/10. A nice break from all the mainstream AAA stuff going around.",,theascent,r/theascent,2023-09-22T06:10:29.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just 100% it including DLC and Platinum trophy.

The DLC is pretty good. My main complaint with the DLC was no level increases. I finished the main game maxed out. The DLC gives you a lot more components to upgrade weapons sure…but overall character level isn’t increased. Almost had a “what’s the point” feel to it. Also the bug at the end of the DLC wouldn’t load recognize that I completed the DLC. It’s an endless load screen. So technically I never finished the DLC haha. You’ll beat the boss but the load screen never finishes. I got the DLC for $5 on PS4 so I wasn’t sorely disappointed but if I paid anymore than that not worth it. I say the DLC is worth a few bucks if you want more or the same and some new areas to mess around with.

"Is this anyone else's least favorite place? There's nothing up here except the board, and two parks with views that are too clouded to see anything.

There's a TON of people walking around but There's no obvious place for them to live or even work so what are they all doing?

You look down in the middle  and you don't see apartments or condos or anything a person can travel. It all looks like tech/infrastructure support stuff.

So this is pretty much the most empty region, no side quests no gangs(this part makes sense, top security for the rich)

I get that each tier could be a hundred floors or so, so looking down in the middle you'd see nothing, but it just creates some cognitive dissonance. Just a couple hundred people waking around, with no reason to be up there.

Also... in  &gt;! The board room, WHY did that ship explode out of another skyscraper in the distance or fly through it, it was clear they were sent to attack you, so I doubt they were having piloting troubles !&lt;

This just feels like the most empty region of the game. And don't get me wrong 5000% I love the game. My biggest gripe, is its not long enough,  there isn't an endgame. Or even  sidequest optional bosses that are significantly harder than the story or something. They could've put anything. 

So my biggest gripe is there isn't ENOUGH of this game.  Because it is amazing, not trying to hate on the devs. They did the best they could with the resources and budget they had, and it's phenomenal for a top down twin stick shooter.

"Heyo all! Just started playing ""The Ascent"" (brand new physical disc) this past week &amp; it's an amazing game until after the last save crashed - now game will not load. Every other game from disc works so it's definitely not the PS4 as it runs perfectly.

I had character to Lvl 10 from a few playthroughs/saves &amp; the last save crashed. I read up on fixes including one that helped multiple ppl - starting the game not from the UI game icon but from the Start button below the icon but still did not work.

I've since deleted game app &amp; reDLed multiple xs (originally on extended storage then onto system storage), deleted game save prof/settings (so literally restarting from scratch), &amp; tried starting game from a separate PSN account on the PS4 &amp; still, nothing, just black screen after dev names.

Does anyone have a fix for this? I've exhausted all obvious options &amp; don't understand how it worked normally from the original disc download &amp; now just will not load at all w everything done above.

Update: Just cleared cache/power cycle, rebuilt database, &amp; reDLed &amp; still, nothing. Same black screen after dev name opening. I'm outta options.

"I understand your frustration, this case especially. My buddy and I just got done ripping through this game and I was devastated to find out the studio got bought out, meaning there more than likely wouldn’t be any future content or sequels. We played digitally downloaded copies from the PS store on PS5. The most annoying bug we ran into was the non-host player in the game would sometimes get completely frozen talking to an npc and we’d just have to force quit the game and join back up. I had heard horror stories of ppl losing their save files and stuff, but never saw what you are experiencing.

I know this doesn’t help, but those devs more than likely didn’t ask for or celebrate being bought out and having the game they worked hard on tossed in the trash. It’s just more corporate bullshit that has been ruining video gaming for years. Morons at the top making decisions from their yachts or beach mansions that only have money on their mind and have absolutely no pride in the quality of work they’re responsible for.

Everyone who asks for a similar game gets told to play Helldivers. We started it after the Ascent and it’s good but it falls way short for me, namely the fact that when you play co-op, your camera is shared and you cannot leave the screen. If you primarily play games for single player, then this might be a really good option for you.

I had heard horror stories of ppl losing their save files and stuff, but never saw what you are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this doesn’t help, but those devs more than likely didn’t ask for or celebrate being bought out and having the game they worked hard on tossed in the trash. It’s just more corporate bullshit that has been ruining video gaming for years. Morons at the top making decisions from their yachts or beach mansions that only have money on their mind and have absolutely no pride in the quality of work they’re responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who asks for a similar game gets told to play Helldivers. We started it after the Ascent and it’s good but it falls way short for me, namely the fact that when you play co-op, your camera is shared and you cannot leave the screen. If you primarily play games for single player, then this might be a really good option for you. I grabbed the Helldivers + all DLCs physical copy used in great condition on eBay for like $15 I think?&lt;/p&gt;

"That's great you guys were able to finish the game on PS5 via digital DL - were you able to play/finish the DLCs? I ask out of curiosity because bugs were rampant there as well on both PS4/5. In terms of digi v phys, it's the same app, just different license so I don't think that's the root of the bugs.

I hear you &amp; wholeheartedly agree on corporate greed, it's a world killer. Who knows the ins &amp; outs of the 11 team Neon Giant sale but ""The Ascent"" was released 1¼ yrs before sale so there was time to fix bugs on their baby.

And ty for the HDs recommendation, it's 1 of my favs - already topped leaderboard awhile back &amp; cannot wait for HD2 - it's gonna be insane!

With that said, HDs &amp; Ascent (when working) are amazing games but two completely different animals w twin stick isometric, killing aliens &amp; Swedish devs being the only similarities. HDs is a beloved top-down strategic team shooter only whereas Ascent is RPG storyline driven.

"Ok, so some new positive results! Yay for progression!

I've finally, successfully loaded The Ascent. On Ascent's official Discord, I was offered a helpful tip to load game while offline then once loaded, reconnect the network.

So PS4 steps: go to Settings, Network, then unclick ""Connect to the Internet"". Then click Ascent icon in UI menu or press down from icon &amp; use ""Start"" button (which is another helpful tip that helped others because it is thought that the run.exe times out when just clicking the game icon but not from the ""Start"" button below the menu game icon).

Unfortunately, none of these worked as it still black screen no load.

What I did learn from this tip was to delete the Ascent app &amp; reDL it while offline. I reDLed onto my external Samsung SSD (which it was originally installed on) to test if the external v internal storage actually mattered.

After install finished, I clicked Ascent icon like normal &amp; BOOM, it loaded - And quick too! Originally, after the dev names opening there would be a sec or so lag until the title screen appeared but here, it was instant.

So, because I installed app offline, it did not install Version 1.05 &amp; is currently on the original Version 1.00 so obviously bugs are in versions 1.02 to 1.05 - it's unfortunate the updates/fixes introduced new bugs...

I'm gonna start a new game on V1.00 &amp; just play awhile, see if any bugs occur &amp; if game allows me to continue, I'll copy saves onto a flash drive.

Then if game remains stable, I'll reconnect network, DL V1.05, &amp; keep🤞.

Someone said bugs occurred after V1.03 - does anyone know if you can DL each version separately? (I've researched but found no separate DLs for each version) That way, you could narrow the bug scope down to the specific update version &amp; go from there.

&lt;p&gt;Do you think frequent saving (every 15 min - even if this means exiting game and coming back in) would minimize damage of bug progress deletion?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBH, getting up and stretching every 15 minutes isn&amp;#39;t the worst idea out there...&lt;/p&gt;

1. Start your game on ONLINE COOP and host your game.

2. Beat the final boss on the DLC.

3. Be patient and the game should load completely so you can continue.

4. It may take a few tries but repeat the process if the issue occurs again.

"dont sleep on the rejuv field tactical to stay alive. also seconding the person who said to throw on the IO converter aug and activate while firing.

Some boss fights took me 20-30 tries (like, 3 sit-down sessions and tapping out since i felt ""on-tilt"").

This is a lesson: be a couple levels above the ""suggested"" mission level, or you are gonna be having a darksouls-ish roll/dodge party for soneme encounters :) (EDIT: I dont use the taxi or metro much, the game is beautiful, and running between places, you get in fights: good for XP/leveling, and good for training how to stay alive in combat!)

that being said, keep moving if you keep finding yourself in the red-circle explosion radius. dont try and tank that shit.

"The suggested level should be raised or the fight nerfed. Only because it tricks you into thinking your ready for it. I think I literally got to 17 before I killed it. And I stacked fire resistance and leveled up the energy weapons for mech damage. But it still took me till 17.

All the energy weapons I had available either did no damage if they were range.  Or it was a shotgun that did a lot of damage but you died from getting close enough to be attacked by it. 

Maybe if you're an expert in the stats it's easy at 13. But I followed the obvious fire resistance (which felt like it did 0 damage reduction) and the energy weapons, still did not kill it until lvl 17. But my gripe is it's not intuitive or explained in a tutorial, the stats are just there.

Not knocking the boss so don't hate me. I just think for most of the main story missions. The suggested level has the biggest miss match here.

"I don't have the exact references handy - but I've read so much good news and great reviews about this game. I've worked in the games industry before - at WB and under the Xbox org - when something starts off as solid as this did - let's say 50% reviews or greater- there's no reason why a studio wouldn't continue to add content, expand the world, and then maybe even create a sequel.

What was the point of the studio getting acquired if the acquiring entity doesn't expand the marquee project that got the developers such attention?

I can see the acquisition being to grab the talent and put them on a different project - but starting from zero takes years. This game is phenomenal. It has its bugs - but those can be fixed, and there's so many campaigns, expansions, chapters, or sequels that could be created off of this amazing IP.

Can you imagine a sandbox environment for people to create levels for others to play? Challenges and instances for parties of four to run?

I'm only new to this game as of a month - played it for about a day, got to level 10 as a couch co-op - had my character progress heartbreakingly deleted (bug) - but I do want to spin it back up and play online co-op. I'm very surprised that there is a discussion of a sequel or support - this thing is a true testament to the developers capabilities - to the attention and attraction to the genre (both isometric twin stick shooters and cyberpunk world development).

Yeah when they swarm in the deep stink it's hard not to die over and over   You can try to be mobile   Use cover.   But ur gonna die.  The good news is you pay very little price and you start right back up and get another chance.  Pretty soon u will be able to buff ur HP and weapon strength to handle it.  After that recognize that you should focus upgrading one energy weapon and one bullet weapon.  The metallic enemies and bots are more susceptible to energy attacks and the organics bullets.,,theascent,r/theascent,2023-08-11T17:41:44.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah when they swarm in the deep stink it&amp;#39;s hard not to die over and over   You can try to be mobile   Use cover.

2. Are melee weapons good I bought the baseball bat , but couldn't figure out how to use it . then strangely it disappeared from my arsenal   
3. I am constantly throwing grenades by mistake by accidentally  licking L3 . Can i reconfig and what button do you use

1. The Navigation seems tedious and no waypoint placement , i was trying to find the shop that upgrades weapons , gave up looking after a while&lt;br/&gt;
2. Are melee weapons good I bought the baseball bat , but couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to use it . then strangely it disappeared from my arsenal&lt;br/&gt;
3. I am constantly throwing grenades by mistake by accidentally  licking L3 . Can i reconfig and what button do you use&lt;br/&gt;

"1. Yeah there's only navigation to objectives and the map sucks for telling what level something is on.  If you stick with the game, you will eventually learn the the layout.
2. You have to equip the bat, but it's not worth it.  That's the only melee weapon AFAIK.  It's a twin stick shooter, you should be shooting.  The punch aug you get early on is your best up-close damage dealing option and I kept that equipped for the first half the game.
3. I don't know, didn't have the need to remap controls personally.
4. Augs can be equipped at any time, but they will fully drain your energy (mana) when you change them.  Energy is regained pretty quickly so there's not much reason to have a surgeon do it other than you happened to be at a surgeon to do skill upgrades anyway and decided to swap out augs at the same time.

BTW I just beat it last night, and I don't have a particularly high opinion of it.  It's not bad, just could have been lot better.

however i noticed a few remaining bugs ( ennemies laying on ground but moving somehow , a few times my tactical auto turret is afk which made me scream of anger a few times when i m getting swarmed from everywhere ) also i hate how the checkpoints system in this game works ( sometimes you respawn somewhere you didnt actually explore , when you die you still keep the exp / loot which personally doesnt make sense for me ).
Oh also i finished it on hard mode , usually finishing games on the hardest difficulty feels rewarding , and u actually feel proud but i didnt get that feeling with the ascent : ennemies are either super weak or some of them are super tanky even with the appropriate type of ammo.
Otherwise great game would recommend , hope for a ( better ) sequel :)",,theascent,r/theascent,2023-08-05T19:07:34.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep just finished it today on ps5 , super fun !! the cyberpunk world/ lore is actually super sick ( i would argue the lore is better than cyberpunk 2077 by far )

"The world they've created is an abaolute marvel. But I felt like it drops a shit ton on you from the get go. There's no ease-in, characters speak in a very technical language, a lot of mumbo jumbo explanations about in-game technology, it made the conversations unengaging to me. At first I chose to ask the additional questions but after getting the same out of context mumbo jumbo I just dropped it. I barely even listened to what the story was from then on. The way the conversarions themselves played out was also unengaging, your character sits there with their back turned to the camera and the npc is info-dumping on you. It's obvious the devs were more focused on gameplay and visuals rather than story and that's perfectly fine.

Visually they killed it. Gameplay mechanics are fun, but the walls-of-text explanations for all the other stuff is unnecessary, coulda just made 2-3 missions that teach you how to pick and choose weapons, armor, modules, augmentations, etc. It *looks* complicated because it's visually heavy on the screen, but it's pretty simple in reality.

"We'll start of with the pros then move to the cons, this is all my opinion and I haven't watched any videos or media of the game either. 

Pros:
1: The Soundtrack is great, absolutely love it, it fits the scenery of the city incredibly well
2: the sfx in general work very well, from shooting guns and explosions to breaking boxes and ambient sounds, it all fits. 
3: the non-pve areas feel dense and lived in. From the pollution to overcrowding in certain areas, it feels like a dystopian city, 10/10
4: the camera, this is a pro and a con for me, I absolutely love how entering certain areas will cause the camera to tilt in such a way to emphasize the city and it's megastructures. Really helps make me feel as if I am IN the city. 
5: the menu, it's a small feature, but I definitely appreciate the fact that the character you have made appears on the building in the menu, wearing all the clothes that you have currently equipped. Another wonderful feature that expands the world just a bit. Other AAA Games should definitely take notice of this feature. 

Cons:
1: the menu ui is incredibly sensitive, I'd like to be able to scroll between pages using only L1 and R1, I often find myself screening through pages unnecessarily when scrolling the map. 
2: there is NO sensitivity slider, Ive found that the default sensitivity definitely doesn't work for me. 
3: the camera, so much to talk about here, I'll often find that the camera is pointing in the complete opposite direction of where I'd like it to face, this makes combat very tedious feeling at times and is just a plain old buzz kill if it causes me to die (I've died once so far and i can definitely say it's because of the camera and some unfortunate placement at times). I do completely believe in the fact that if this game was a 1st or 3rd person shooter, basically eliminating all of the camera cons I have just mentioned, this game would be a contender for an award or 2 at the Game awards. 

4: This is probably the biggest one for me, THE PHOTOMODE, it's terrible, I absolutely love doing Virtual Photography in games that I play, I've been doing it since I got my Ps5 and it's a determining factor on whether or not I buy a game. This Photomode is truly dissapointing. There is little to nothing that works for it. 

Currently though, after 3 hours of playing, I can say that I am enjoying this game, I can't wait to see how this game and it's plot unfolds. And I do hope the game takes up 20-30 hours to complete the game, I currently have my eye on getting the Platinum trophy for it.

I agree with most of what you're saying but 

&gt;I do completely believe in the fact that if this game was a 1st or 3rd person shooter, basically eliminating all of the camera cons I have just mentioned

It would be a completely different game and it wouldn't be a twin-stick shooter.

I especially agree with what you said about photo-mode, it's garbage and almost entirely pointless.

&gt;I absolutely love doing Virtual Photography in games that I play, I've been doing it since I got my Ps5 and it's a determining factor on whether or not I buy a game.

"Couldn’t agree more, just a shame that the poor optimization and development have lead to the game being unplayable on PS4/PS5 for most. 

And even more unfortunate, most of the game-breaking bugs are such simple fixes. One example is one I encountered within the first hour of gameplay on PS4, now given, this was on co-op, so I am unsure the validity of the bug as it may not exist for solo-players, but, when I went to go to my journal to look at my gear, I immediately had my HUD freeze and then stay on my screen permanently, not allowing me to close it. Then, I also had the shop interaction menu not appear, leaving my character permanently stuck as though I was glancing at the HUD. And the worst of all, the crashes.

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m pretty sure i read specifically about Neon Giant asking and getting non-responses or non-obligatory answers from Sony as to why they kept it locked to Sony Consoles... they seem to only be allowing mass market AAA developers... (Activision, EA and the like)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this has been an issue since the PS4, read a few articles about it, my best guess is that they don&amp;#39;t want to risk losing elements of market share to Microsoft... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is odd to me still b/c this year Microsoft publicly stated that they [already lost the console war to Sony...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiderbots is my go too.  And also that ability that transfers damage done to health restored the more pain u dish out the more ur hit points are restored.  It&amp;#39;s a massive win.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to the DLC protector pistol and katana is my go too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise I power up protector pistol and energy weapon auto Matic sun machine gun or assault rifle.   But for most of the game I go with the protector pistol as a john wick/ Bladerunner style&lt;/p&gt;

I have (my regular) three questions about this game, at least in the first run... 

1: Does the PC version of this game have console commands available?

"I was really, really enjoying my first 10 hours of the game.It was running smoothly on my hardware with high settingsten hours in, i get an error on reload after dying and lose my entire save file, and since then the game crashes before getting underway.

typically my computer power faults when the game goes from the ""wall of skulls"" splash screen to the true title screen, the one that shows the current character and your starting options.

I have tried a LOT of recommends from the internet here:

\-updated drivers,-uninstall/reinstall both via steam and windows,-hard capping the frame rate at 30 via the nvida ap,-forcing dx11,-forcing windowed mode,-forcing 1920 x 1080,-adding allow firewall rule,-closing background aps etc.-moving the game to the same hdd as the OS/my ap data-running the ap explicitly as admin

About 1 time in 20 it will load and run, but only for about half an hour, then it will crash - typically when i buy something or make a change to my loadout.

I have a pet theory - this is actually happening when the game goes to read/write save data, it's not really a video problem.  the game runs well when it runs. Cleaning out my saves manually will get the game to run for a little bit, like a few minutes, but it typically still crashes before finishing character creation.

I know that is a little superstitious but simply put, the game was running beautifully and then stopped - it didn't have a problem with my hardware or settings for the first three days I played it, i had one crash, and after that crash it never ran right again -  so I feel like maybe there's a corrupt file somewhere?

My PSU seems to be giving steady, in spec power, my mobo and video card don't seem to be overheating, I really don't understand what's going on here.

My local ap data is on an ssd and my main steam collection is on a bigger hdd

My PC is a ryzen 7 3.2, 32 gig of gskill ram, psu, and gfx card are all EVGA, psu is a 650, mobo is an asus rog strix b-450, gfx card is an rtx 2070 (older stuff overall i know but it runs cyberpunk, sf6, other newer games without issue)

Would love some thoughts on getting this otherwise great game to actually work so i can finish it. thanks in advance.  


Edit: Other games are getting erratic as well, i PROBABLY need a new psu :( ",,,r/theascent,2023-07-03T17:30:40.000Z,post,,,Bug,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was really, really enjoying my first 10 hours of the game.It was running smoothly on my hardware with high settingsten hours in, i get an error on reload after dying and lose my entire save file, and since then the game crashes before getting underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;typically my computer power faults when the game goes from the &amp;quot;wall of skulls&amp;quot; splash screen to the true title screen, the one that shows the current character and your starting options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried a LOT of recommends from the internet here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-updated drivers,-uninstall/reinstall both via steam and windows,-hard capping the frame rate at 30 via the nvida ap,-forcing dx11,-forcing windowed mode,-forcing 1920 x 1080,-adding allow firewall rule,-closing background aps etc.-moving the game to the same hdd as the OS/my ap data-running the ap explicitly as admin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 1 time in 20 it will load and run, but only for about half an hour, then it will crash - typically when i buy something or make a change to my loadout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a pet theory - this is actually happening when the game goes to read/write save data, it&amp;#39;s not really a video problem.  the game runs well when it runs. Cleaning out my saves manually will get the game to run for a little bit, like a few minutes, but it typically still crashes before finishing character creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that is a little superstitious but simply put, the game was running beautifully and then stopped - it didn&amp;#39;t have a problem with my hardware or settings for the first three days I played it, i had one crash, and after that crash it never ran right again -  so I feel like maybe there&amp;#39;s a corrupt file somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My PSU seems to be giving steady, in spec power, my mobo and video card don&amp;#39;t seem to be overheating, I really don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My local ap data is on an ssd and my main steam collection is on a bigger hdd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My PC is a ryzen 7 3.2, 32 gig of gskill ram, psu, and gfx card are all EVGA, psu is a 650, mobo is an asus rog strix b-450, gfx card is an rtx 2070 (older stuff overall i know but it runs cyberpunk, sf6, other newer games without issue)&lt;/p&gt;

"It's a decent game. Fun at first but does get a bit repetitive. Sometimes mission objectives aren't clear or they lead you to the wrong locations forcing you to exit the game and re-load your save to see the true objective (which if you aren't aware of can lead to frustrating and head scratching moments). Game still has two unforgivable bugs however, and players should be aware of them.

1. You can be shot and killed during a cut scene, which will force you to run all the way back to that spot and do the scene again. This should not be possible, yet it is.
2. If you are really unlucky, your character can randomly delete itself. It's a good idea to manually create a backup save if you are on PC as there is nothing more frustrating than putting 10+ hours into your character and then it's just...gone.

"Having played the game before probably about midway through, I re-started after buying the DLC and found new gear to be bought at surprisingly low prices in the shops, right out of the gate.

...And it's a cakewalk.

Previously challenging fights like the four big cybers you intercept before the stackbosses' moot, or the first OV mission to execute their operative on a penthouse surrounded by Rojin, have become simple afairs.

"I posted this on PSNProfiles, but perhaps not everyone will be looking for info there: I ran into a bug where the Aficionado trophy doesn't unlock despite upgrading a weapon to Mk.10. I don't know exactly what caused this. It may have been that I had partly upgraded three weapons (my first to Mk.6, my second to Mk.5 and my last to Mk.9). Upgrading a later weapon to a higher degree than the first weapon you updated has been reported to cause the bug. Or it might have been that I did a local coop session inbetween my single-player playthrough, which also has been described as possibly breaking some counters (I will have to see how it will work out with the Suicidal trophy which I still have to obtain).
 
I tried upgrading the first weapon to Mk.10, then the second one, then the third one, then buying a new one and upgrading that one, doing everything in local coop and in online coop as the host -- nothing worked.
 
Solution: I joined another player in online coop (you can of course also do this yourself with a second account and second PS4), played so that the game saved, left, continued in single-player and upgraded a newly-bought weapon from scratch, and the trophy unlocked. So joining online coop as guest does seem to unblock the trophy.
 
Hopefully this helps out some of you. Alternatively, you would have to rush through the game with a new character and reach the point where you can upgrade a weapon to Mk.10, but this would definitely take longer than the approach above.

That being said there are no weak weapons in the ascent, theyre all useable and theres enough easily available resources to spec every weapon to around tier 5 to try them out.

"I started playing a few days ago, and these are the things I'm glad I found out before I progressed too far.

Regarding weapon upgrades:  
It is important to save your superior components until you figure out which weapons you want to max out.  You can always farm more of the basic and advanced components from bounties, but there is a hard cap on the superior components.  You can get multiple weapons to Mk.8 with just basic and advanced components, but you only get enough superior components to get 2 weapons to Mk.10.

Regarding character build:  
Skill points will increase a specific attribute.  Different attributes will buff specific augmentations.  Play around with this to figure out how you want to build your character in a way that maximizes your damage and survivability.  If you need to respec those points, head to the grafter... but know that the higher your level the more expensive these respecs will be.",,theascent,r/theascent,2023-06-02T01:23:25.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing a few days ago, and these are the things I&amp;#39;m glad I found out before I progressed too far.&lt;/p&gt;

SO what you need to do is make sure your friend has the same version as you.  You can literally just launch game and look in bottom right and it&amp;#39;ll say I think it was 72946 or whatever, alternatively you can check steam also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, so my buddy had the legit copy and I saw someone said if they have the legit copy then you can&amp;#39;t play with them, so I made them move there steam_api64.dll to a backup folder on the desktop and copy all the steamworks files &amp;quot;Online Fix.ini, OnlineFix64.dll, steam_api64.dll, steam_api64.of&amp;quot; into there ascent folder typically found at &amp;quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Ascent\steamapps\common\The Ascent\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Steamworks\Steamv152\Win64&amp;quot;  folder or wherever it is on there pc.

"Just bought the game on sale for PS5. Mostly fine so far, but man there are head scratching decisions.

- None of the UI was designed for consoles, or TV sets. Text is exceedingly hard to read on the couch even on a 55' 4K TV. Devs need to learn to scale the text resolution appropriately. 
- The in game map is poorly designed and weird to navigate.
- The menu in-game is also weird to navigate.
- The only good audio is the Indent Mode. None of the others remotely immerse you in the game effectively. 
- Encountered a bug where I died too close to a locked zone (Black Lake), and when I spawned, I was on the other side. I hadn't unlocked fast travel yet, but was able to ""use""  the Metro. Except selecting a previous area just reloaded me back into the same place, and the game didn't tell me that it needed to be unlocked first. Spent a couple hours roaming the area, encountering some over leveled enemies, and other enemies I was able to kite and farm a bit. Then I got the idea (after understanding how the auto save and map kinda worked) I noticed that when I got close to the locked door, I was technically in Nitrod. So I quit out and loaded back into the correct zone this time. Seems like an odd way to get stuck somewhere. Guess that's what I get for roaming around instead of completing the second mission.

Also, I played on pc with a controller and it’s not optimized for much. 
It’s a lot of fun and you’ll quickly look past those notes because of the robust scenery, the ability to earn money and keep earning it (ie, spawn in and out of an area and collect the same loot), the fun ways the augments and weapons and tactical items pair. 
They hit a nerve for me with this game and I’m really not sure what it was. 
It felt genuine and loving if that’s worth anything haha.&lt;/p&gt;

"I have not played either of your reference games. I have enjoyed other twinstick-y games like Alienation and X-Morph Defense.



I was not a big fan of The Ascent in part due to all the walking/backtracking. There is a fast-travel system but there are pretty large parts of the map it doesn't cover, so walking back and forth dozens of times through familiar environments is unavoidable. I got the impression the devs were so in love with their own world that they wanted to force players to spend hours needlessly walking back and forth through it. The world is great, but not so great that it doesn't get old walking through the same area for the fifth time.



In other news I was not a huge fan of the gameplay - felt kind of rudimentary without as much emphasis on abilities or customization as I would have liked. I feel like I spent a huge chunk of the game just doing the same thing shooting the same weapons at progressively chunkier enemies without a ton of new encounters (in part because you are forced to fight the exact same enemies over and over again as they respawn every time you leave and re-enter an area).

"I've probably played for about 10-15 hours on PS4 and I'm level 19 atm. Haven't had more than 3 crashes overall (bit annoying) and some rare stutters.

Currently feel very mixed on it. The gameplay feels very solid imo. Each gun feels authentic and their feedback is great, haven't got tired of shooting. 

I also like how is makes appearance AND equipment customization very accessible by its economy. Every time you come back from a mission you should have enough resources to change almost everything about your character and not feel like you're hindering yourself.

World design, character design, VOICE ACTING, vfx and music are simply great. Therefore, the whole traversal and backtracking doesn't feel cumbersome to me. The immersion package overall is one of the best I've experienced in terms of Indies/Double A's. Nothing to complain here.

I really like this game, I WANT to keep enjoying it. And there's even more I could say... HOWEVER. Some stuff just takes you out from the experience, let me explain:

EVEN THOUGH you might be doing a mission on your level, it seems the enemies scale from the stage so while you're heading to your objective you might stumble across enemies 8 levels higher than you and you're dead. Making you either:

- having to work your way around the whole map to the other side (sometimes finding more overscaled enemies either way)

-spending resources to fast travel to another different location

-trying to pass through all of them spamming evade so you can die repeatedly and respawn a little closer to your objective.


Another thing. Some sidequests take you to places/NPCs that you can't even access yet due to the campaign. But there's no disclaimer for that, meaning you could be progressing a mission of which you're not even sure you can actually finish right now, only finding out after a whole lot of fighting and traveling just to hit a wall and having to come back around.

The difficulty spikes on some moments. I've started on Hard but have since gone to Normal or even Easy just to be able to complete a few specific fights even though I'm at an appropriate level with upgraded guns. Call me trash at the game but I never had this with several Ruiner or Hotline Miami playthroughs.

These are some odd design flaws that stop me from praising this game. It feels as this clearly needed a few more months in the oven for tweaks and balances before release. And I'm lucky because some PS4's can't even run the application for it.

&lt;p&gt;It’s been so long since I’ve been excited and gripped by a game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of the first n second baulder’s gate but cyber punk. 
All in all, I’d take this game over cyberpunk2077. 
This feels like the devs love the game as much as the players - or I hope that’s the case. 
So many stories and untapped art and rooms and scenes. 
Love it love it love it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope there’s an MMO aspect around the corner. Destiny-ish stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks y’all. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

Fresh off &gt;!John Wick 4!&lt; and man, that scene made me wanna play a top-down shooter.

From what I'm reading and watching, the combat is intense but not as arcade-y as other games, it's got RPG elements, destructible environments, and I can't wait to see how the special abilities would look. Not to mention, it's very pretty on the eyes too, both in aesthetic design and graphics. I can only nitpick, like is it drop-in/drop-out? Are there other game modes for when I complete the game or does replay value extend to ""restart the game""? I was willing to buy this game as soon as it goes on sale.

…until I heard that some PS4 players can't even start the game.

I consider myself lucky it wasn't on sale and I was reading on everything about it in the meantime because goddamn, the amount of PS4 users complaining about not being able to start the game is very consistent, worse that coop breaks the game.

The final nail in the coffin containing my hype is THE LAST PATCH WAS 8 MONTHS AGO?? Have the devs stopped working on this?? If it's been 8 months since the last update, it's probably not getting fixed at all, is it?

2 freezes

"The map is tough. Pretty much the last thing I learned to look at. I don’t know how they could have done it better given the ‘chosen’ camera placement/movement. It takes a bit more looking at than a tradition top down map most of us are used to seeing. It doesn’t show blockages so you have to work those out yourself making what could be a short trip a longer trip around. That being said they did a great job of making this place feel like it has depth and you get a feel for how compact, rather dense, this “huge” section of an even huger complete whole. Depth, plenty of it and they use the layout very well to get the gears going in your head about “hmmm, now how do I get there” which soon becomes familiar to work out and learn the dynamic use of the vertical space you’re walking in. Your brain kind of build a 3D map and makes suggestion “hey what about around this corner and inside this building there may be a staircase”. Little confusing at first but that’s because this is a game of its own in this genre, navigation starts strange and you get to know it.
