"EDIT #2

Originally I posted to ask what causes the character to look more like a cyborg, since Google just finds old threads with all kinds of theories; total skill points spent, number of deaths, specific augmentations, etc.

So I backed up my save and did some experiments, initially concluding that Motorics causes the face to look cybernetic and Biometrics makes the arms and torso look cybernetic.

This was actually incorrect, and I've now determined exactly what causes it:

* The Attribute of the Augmentation in Slot 1 affects the look of the character's face (e.g. if you have Hydraulic Slam in Slot 1, increasing Motorics will make the character's face look more cybernetic, up to 40).
* The Attribute of the Augmentation in Slot 2 affects the look of the character's body (e.g. if you have Mono Scrapper in Slot 2, increasing Cybernetics will make the character's arms and body look more cybernetic, up to 40).
* Attributes currently affecting the character's appearance are indicated by their values having a circuit board effect around them on the Character tab.
* Attribute bonuses from equipment also contribute, but may take a bit to catch up.
* Resetting skills instantly removes any cybernetics, changing Augments to one with a different Attribute instantly changes/updates them.

"Hi guys, I just watched a video on how to get early the overwhelmer.

i am currently at level 15. doing the data miners (5th main mission)

I have the hmg42 dominator, es4 eraser, bitsplit etc (at upgrade 3)

thats the thing, so far it is a good weapon that makes all other unplayable (i am still level 15 :D and have the base weapons, maybe this will change soon)

i want to try maybe the roomsweeper, and eraser.

i have them and a couple more to level 3. how many weapons do you think i can ""freely"" level up to lets say, 4 or 5? 

with freely i mean in a way so that when i want to level a good late game weapon i am not lacking materials :)

You can easily get 5 or more weapons to lvl 5. I think i had roughly 75% of the games weapons to lvl 5 or 8 by the end of my 1st play through. Lvl 9/10 upgrades are a bit more rare. At the end game or before you should easily have enough upgrades to max out at least 3/5 weapons. It also gets easier to farm the upgrades from bounties as you lvl higher so there's no need to ne very conservative with your resources.,,theascent,r/theascent,2023-02-20T00:53:35.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can easily get 5 or more weapons to lvl 5.

"So i recently just finished my first play through of the main story and im now playing the Cyber Heist DLC.

Since ive already fully upgraded all the guns that i primarily use, ive been using my extra upgrade materials to experiment of other guns.

Im doing a Heavy Gunner build (Strikebreaker/Dealbreaker + Overwhelmer/ABR Commander) So i decided to try the Dominator. I get that its supposed to be a rapid fire HMG, kind of like a early version of the Strikebreaker, but the fact that you can get the Overwhelmer(Upgraded/modified version of Dominator) much earlier, whats the point of the Dominator?

Even as a Heavy Gunner build, the Overwhelmer with a mag size of 20 performs as a much better HMG than the Dominator¡¯s 100 round mag.

Will there be anymore DLC asides from Cyber-Heist?",,,r/theascent,2023-02-17T20:52:46.000Z,post,,,Discussion,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So i recently just finished my first play through of the main story and im now playing the Cyber Heist DLC.&lt;/p&gt;

* NPC co-op partners. Mercenaries, thugs, retired security guys looking for a thrill, etc. that you could find in any pub and hire for a few thousand uCreds. It would be very fitting in the world too, I think.
* More stuff to spend money on, in addition to the above. Maybe buyable components, but only basic and advanced ones and the latter would be rather expensive? Special weapons and armor that can't be found in the wild? I finished the game with about 400k bucks in my wallet and the only thing that would make a significant dent in that is respeccing, which costs me like 180k
* We can equip two weapons, two augs, but only one tactical? Right stick click isn't used for anything, right?
* This would probably end up being a bit overpowered, but an ability (obviously a late game one)  to let you hack robot enemies and turn them into allies or disabling them or something for a short while could have been pretty cool.
* Actual consequences for killing civilians, instead of just Kira telling you to stop being naughty? I know the game mentions at some point that the local security corp is gone or something, but mowing down dozens of panicking civilians in the Cosmodrome without any consequences feels a bit lame.
* A couple things to do and see in The Pinnacle? It was a bit disappointing and underwhelming. Every tier below it is huge, with many different areas you can get lost in, and then you reach the top and it's just a couple terraces and the AG headquarters. When Grateful Abbot said to drop by his place and chat I was expecting there to be some kind of sidequest given by him. At least the area looked pretty and sunny.
* An actual boss fight at the end. Holding X in front of some computers to close a red stargate is super lame for a final mission. There's that Dakyne woman but I swear she has less health than the basic ferals in the room.

"Yeah I have gotten half way playing coop and it was going fine but basically my saved game won't load but if we load the game with my friend as host it will load fine.

If I try to load solo with that character I still have NY character, I'm just much further back in the game. Also some item drops won't work randomally in coop.

I haven't really had bugs playing solo, other than a gunfire sound glitch that will correct itself the next time you shoot.

It's been very fun to play easily spent 15 hours on it already. But it was free on game pass. I would probably be willing to spend $30 on it, but not more than that with the current issues.

Yes, I get it, it's the final mission of a game that's meant to be challenging, but when you have to defend a tiny perimeter against tons of enemies coming from three directions simultaneously while your cover only protects you from one, with enemies even shooting from offscreen and others staying at the bottom of that little staircase where you can't even hit them because you can aim up but not down, this shit is hard for all the wrong reasons.

Honestly the absurd difficulty spikes are the worst part of this game, from time to time it'll do this thing where you're having no trouble at all and then suddenly there's so many enemies onscreen shooting so much shit at you that you literally can't even see what's going on.

"I've got The Ascent on PC because I couldn't wait for the PS5 release, and played about 2-3 hours with it. It was fun, interesting promise and gorgeous graphics, cyberpunk lore, what's not to love? I've even paired up a PS controller to my PC (I think the controls are better that way for this style of game), but forgot to continue playing as I mostly use my console (much more convenient for me).

Now it's available on consoles and I was able to snatch it on a deal for 1/3rd of the RRP, and started playing it on the PS5, and holly molly it's like a completely different game, can't put it down!

What I'm talking about is all the small extra effects that are made for the PS5 DualSense controllers: the supporting sounds coming from the controller speaker, the trigger effects, the volumetric rumble makes this game 3x more enjoyable imho!

When I'm reloading my gun I can feel when the ammo gets chucked in, hear the click of the magazine in my hand like the gun would be really there, I can feel the rain droplets splashing on me, it is truly a different experience - last time I felt this about the PS5 DS controller was at Returnal and the AstroBot tech demo, and it's super nice to see that a 3rd party developer incorporates stuff likes this into their game so flawlessly! Well done!

This is the time when I really appreciate all the small tech advancements of the PS controllers through the years compared to Xbox where we basically have the same controller from 15 years ago with a bit of shoe polish, but that's also true for PC where most of this gets lost because of keyboard/mouse input. Again, I've tried playing with a DS controller on PC but it's missing all the small effects that I really appreciate at this game!

You get to a point that you own everything and done everything but there is only so much you can upgrade before higher tier components are all used up and you will end up with massive sums of cash with nothing to use it on.&lt;/p&gt;

"When I reinstalled/restarted the game last weekend, everything was ""ultra"" setting... and my GPU started spinning like crazy. 3000 rpm?

I changed everything to medium, disabled all the raytracing options, and it's still running a little hot. 75¢ªC... peaking at 80¢ªC sometimes. Fans run a little over 2000 rpm.

So... yeah. I think this game run a little hot.

(Your experience may vary, I did set custom fan curves so mine run a little hot instead of having a lot of fan noise.)

"No. The DPS values are correct and scale as they do. It's just the damage multiplier (digital Vs mech) that changes. If all 3 are I/O converted to digital damage, the order of damage is 1.Dealbreaker 2.MG1000 Strikebreaker 3.STROBOS

I don't know what the multipliers are. But as an example, let's say Ballistics is 0.5x against the Mech, Energy is 1.0x against the Mech and Digital is 1.5x against the Mech.

Then with an I/O Converter, Dealbreaker is doing 1.5x1,119 DPS, MG1000 is doing 1.5x487 DPS, and STROBOS is doing 1.5x357 DPS. (Against Mechs)


If you are using I/O Converter, you don't need STROBOS as Dealbreaker or MG1000 will do more DPS. 

Practically though it's hard to tell the difference between STROBOS and MG1000 on an I/O Converter because Lock-On Fire shoots so fast. Dealbreaker is noticeably better. Especially against the tougher flying boss Mechs.

"To my knowledge Weapon Handling affects reload speed and has no effect on the melee weapons. It does affect weapon swap speed, if you switch between another weapon to melee.

Aiming affects the spread recovery speed and because melee has no spread, this stat also has no benefit to melee weapons.

Skills useful for melee are Tactical (to get charge quick), Critical Hit Rate (to get big hits more often), Balance (to reduce stuns and knockback), Evasion (to zip around more frequently), Vital Signs (to increase your health), Body Battery (to increase your energy capacity).

&amp;#x200B;

Life Transfer with melee is very effective as the damage is constant from the melee and so long as you have a Life Transfer target you're attacking, you're invincible. Activate it on a mech and you can basically stand next to it and attack it until it dies without worrying (assuming you have good armour), as long as your Vital Signs is decent enough. The issue with it is it's longer cooldown time.

Biometric Timestamp with melee is interesting since it allows you to activate it, go in and do damage and then recover all your health when you're done.

&amp;#x200B;

Overclock is pretty good with melee since you are regenerating health, energy and tactical and you can throw your tactical often with it activated.

"So I'm nearing the end of the game and some of its less well designed elements are starting to grate. So I thought I'd share some ideas on how to turn that around. I'm sure many of you have thought the same but here goes.

Weapons

Component trading. I've got 30 components as they drop from every bounty but no reason to use them. Let me trade up, 5 components for an advanced one or something. At this stage I can't level a new weapon high enough with them to make it usable anyway.

Component buying. I'm absurdly rich with nothing to spend my money on. Cabs are cheap, the best armour is found, I've got all the weapons I need. Let me buy components. Make them expensive.

Higher level bounties. I've only found low-level ones that drop basic components. Maybe there are high level ones or that's something in NG+ but if not, let's have them.

Weapon effects. Increasing base damage when levelling a weapon is important but very basic. Set Mk levels with new properties, like exploding rounds at Mk8 or peircing at Mk10. Right now I'm just upgrading guns to keep them viable.


Armour

Armour upgrades. Most buyable armour is crap compared to what I can find lying around or in chests. Let me spend money to upgrade the armour I like. Transmog is nice but why not make less peices and let us upgrade them, evolving the look and properties. Having different upgrade materials may be too much but could be fun.

Armour shop. It's pointless. I've never bought a single thing from there. It's literally a place to sell my unwanted shit. Get rid or make it a cosmetics shop instead.

Armour drops. There is no point dropping something that has stats in the low teens when my current gear has 40+ protection across the board, per item. It's just junk in my inventory that I have to spend time selling. Loot is nice but make the drops meaningful.


Travel

Sprinting. Jesus Christ let me sprint. I love the huge, overwhelming environments and it's nice to have lots of space to fight in but sometimes I'm just trying to get from A to B. If you're going to send me zig-zagging across the archology for quests, let me sprint!

Multi-level cabs. I guess this may be a loading issue but not one that couldn't be solved. It's nice to get cabs around but having to get a cab to the elevator, then the elevator, then another cab makes backtracking for sidequests a chore.


Anyway, just some ideas. I hope we get an Ascent 2 with some of these deeper mechanics and a less linear story.

The overwhelmer is an AOE damage machine gun, so you can remove hoards as they come, its by default ballistic, so you don't need the IO converter against organics enemies, it melts them on its own.

"I played Seven many years back too and remember enjoying it well. My memory is a bit hazy on it now, but I'll try to note some differences. 

In Seven, there was a lot of opportunity for exploration by means of climbing over, under, and around things. That does not really exist in The Ascent. Most progression is linear, with opportunities to search around buildings and different floors for secrets and stuff. You have your sidequests and missions and dialogue which are pretty straightforward and offer not much in terms of depth or variety since they tend to be just kill the same enemies you've been killing this whole time. 

There are upgrades and stat allocation points in this game. These let you increase your cybernetic damage and as well as providing other stat bonuses for the different categories. Armour has different elemental and kinetic resistances, but I remember armour having additional purposes in Seven that don't exist in Ascent. (I remember you could disguise yourself as an enemy faction or at least get through security checkpoints dressed in their armour). 

The open world is pretty and sounds great. Navigating it may get tedious, as you'll complete a quest in an area and then immediately get sent back to do a random side quest, but the areas are good and combat in them felt fun to me at least.

"So I just finished the game on PS5. In the early stages it was quite engaging and fun to work your way around the various Arcology units, but as I got to around mid game it started to become a bit of a chore to complete missions. It got so boring just running back and forth at a very slow pace, or watching my guy sit in a taxi or stand in a elevator.. 

The gameplay doesn't really expand or become deeper as you progress through the game. The skill points don't seem to make much of a difference, and the random spikes in difficulty were, at times, extremely frustrating for me. 

The presentation of the game and its environments are really polished and detailed, by far the most impressive part of this title. The voice acting was solid, and the characters were well designed and the dialogue well written. 

But seriously, I've seen people complaining about difficulty in the early game, such as the Arachnid boss (which i had no problem with and beat on the first try), but for me it was the final third or so that really started to become frustrating. I don't know if i had a suboptimal build or something, but towards the last few missions, I just couldn't kill the enemies and I'd die really fast. The game throws an absurd amount of stuff at you sometimes and it just feels a little over the top.

I consider myself to be good at games, but this game was honestly one of the most surprisingly difficult games that I've played in a while. Not because it's hard but because of poor design IMO. Theres often too much going on on screen. It felt like I was playing co-op but on my own, that's how many enemies were coming at me. I am convinced I either didn't know something crucial about the gameplay, or my build, or some other mechanic because the game also does a terrible job at explaining stuff.

How do I upgrade the damn Cyberdeck? The game does an abysmal job at explaining the most basic stuff it's ridiculous. 

Towards the end of the game, in the last few missions, I just ran through the combat encounters and ignored the enemies, because the fights would take forever or I'd end up dying and getting respawned miles away and having to do it all over again. I ended up finishing the game at around level 27. 

I applaud the 12 devs who made this game but the flaws just stand out massively for me and take away from all the decent parts about it. I don't even know if I'll go back for the side missions. The game also just ended so abruptly.

6/10.  

TL:DR

The game started out really well but slowly became a repetitive chore with unbelievably frustrating spikes in difficulty, and most likely the worst navigation system I've ever seen in a game. The game fails to explain anything in detail, and while it is environmentally beautiful and polished, it's flaws in gameplay and execution far outweigh these small positives.",,,r/theascent,2023-01-09T21:02:38.000Z,post,,,Discussion,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just finished the game on PS5.

"So, updating the cyberdeck can give you access to chests with some pretty decent gear, guns, and augments that you don¡¯t randomly find, I believe. You just have to find random chests in the wild. Some will drop cyber deck upgrades, which allow you to hack higher level chests. Some drop weapon upgrade materials which help your weapons do more damage. Is it necessary?

Using shock weapons on robotic enemies kills them easier, using ballistic on humans etc will make you more efficient.

On armor, wearing gear with high fire tolerance will help again enemies with fire weapons, high shock tolerance against robotic enemies etc.

so if you get into an encounter and die, you will know how to swap up gear and try again. If that makes sense..

He's an asshole, a hardass, he short changes the indents including you, but he's a reasonable hard and does genuinely care.

His primary concern out of the gate is securing essentials, which is what the meeting you are guarding is meant to do, followed by getting his people back also to keep the habstack running. He wants to get the sector independent and he wants to get everyone free of their indent contracts, so he has you siphon power to get security up and running since CorpSec (I think HabSec sounds better) are going to run once they realize the uCreds are drying up.

Why am I guarding this meeting? Because gangers will disrupt it, and the habstack needs to eat

Why am I grabbing these habbers? Because they were pretty important people needed to ensure the hab keeps running

Why am I trying to siphon power off the deepstink? Because we don't have the resources to get the whole place, and a corp is going to grab it, so we have to be discreet.

"Fanboys seemed to want the game to be perceived as a 'very well-made indie game' by beginners who don't know much about it. Frankly, I'd like to tell them that's more of a paranoia.

From the beginning, I thought the completeness of this game was not good. I also knew that intentionally dividing the narrative, inducing the sale of dlc. In the meantime, inducing meaningless travel time to increase gamers' play time, events that become increasingly dull, and uncharacteristic enemies.

And after a long time, when the gamers forget about their existence, the developers show up and put the dlc that's split like a piece of cake in the customers' mouths sequentially.  
""How is it, dlc? Isn't it delicious?""""  
lol  
I felt like I was trying to follow the customary procedure of Steam Indie Game, which I was most fed up with. (Oh, by the way, I think dlc has a high level of completeness. I'm not trying to devalue this game recklessly. dlc used the space very efficiently within a small area of activity, and there was less clueless mission composition than the main part, and it was very fruitful. I'm a person who thinks it doesn't matter if the price is expensive as long as it shows such excellent quality.)  
  
By the way... After I visited the community, I realized that there were issues of poor access, big and small bugs, and that a significant number of gamers were talking about this problem. So the problem with this game I've been thinking about in the past, it's just the tip of the iceberg.

I'm just surprised. The attitude of the production company, the fanboys who turn a blind eye to the problems, and the buyers who are screaming in pain lol.  
Even after I found out that the company was sold to Krafton, I grabbed my stomach and laughed.  
If there's hell, it's probably here. What a skit this is! This is a matter of course, but the problems experienced by console users are not being communicated to the Steam community because the platforms are different. Nevertheless, quite a few of the actual users who bought this game from Steam are raising the issue. Even though they played the game in a pretty pleasant environment on Steam.

&amp;#x200B;

And you said you were wondering if these fanboys were a developer acquaintance. But I'm a little different from you. I don't care if they're just 'fanboys' or something like a real unknown 'group'.

To be honest, I'm sorry for you, but as I said before, I don't have much passion for this game. So I'm not going to look up posts about The Ascent or look at communities like Reddit in the future.  
It's been months since I deleted this game from Steam in the first place.

I'm telling you this now, but...  
These equivocal types of games are released dozens of times each year via Steam. This game will be completely forgotten in a few months anyway. Just like it's been. It will continue to be the case. Then another The Ascent will be released. lol

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&amp;#39;m sorry for you, but as I said before, I don&amp;#39;t have much passion for this game. So I&amp;#39;m not going to look up posts about The Ascent or look at communities like Reddit in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been months since I deleted this game from Steam in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m telling you this now, but...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These equivocal types of games are released dozens of times each year via Steam. This game will be completely forgotten in a few months anyway. Just like it&amp;#39;s been. It will continue to be the case. Then another The Ascent will be released. lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I being too cynical? I&amp;#39;m truly sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

"lol I hope you don't misunderstand. I never rate this game boring. If I did, I wouldn't have bought a dlc and played it all the way, and I wouldn't have access to this Reddit. I'm just evaluating that dlc was made much better than the original and used limited space efficiently. And based on that standard, I just think the original was designed relatively lazy and insincere. 

The fun of being a third-person shooter is enough. I don't mean to deny it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, let's just skip this...  
I can see that you have access problems with The Ascent. But as you know, developers don't seem to be interested in The Ascent right now. You can wait a long time to communicate with developers, or you can give up this and just take the next best option to use another platform like Steam. 

Of course both would be unsatisfactory choices for you. However, there are definitely buyers who make these inevitable choices because this is a common situation in indie games. At the same time, Steam, the platform on which the game is released for the first time, is also at fault, but...They, too, are always reluctant to take responsibility for problems in the game's distribution process. Of course, this part is the same for Sony. 

Bro, you know that. How 'platform companies' do business.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the story of a fanboy...  
The reason I describe The Ascent as a common type of game that is released dozens of times a year on Steam is that silly fanboys every year unconditionally come along like an appendix to a magazine. 

They often make evasive remarks about why games are not being managed properly, referring to small studios and developers. Reasoned criticism from buyers is not a consideration for them.

Yes, yes... That's right. I've seen this stupid skit countless times through steam games, and this experience was just The Ascent. That's why I'm cynical about this game, and I don't expect it at all. So it's just like a recurring routine lol

"You can upgrade about 3 weapons to MK10 in the base game. 

And several more with Superior components found in the DLC (post main campaign).

MK8 is all you need and you can get Basic and Advanced components from bounties and Mechs.

MK5 is ok and usable but challenging and you want better. 

Room Sweeper and Chrome Puncher are above average weapons. The sniper rifles are just not good in my opinion because the reload is too long, they hit hard against weak enemies but you're fighting many of them and it's not strong enough against tough enemies. Room Sweeper is also decent against weak mobs but also has a short magazine that leaves you reloading too much, too often. 

The Dominator is a better generic weapon throughout all levels in my opinion. ABR Commander is probably the first ""special"" rifle you can get early from the ICE2 chest in town. Followed by the MG1000 Strikebreaker from the shop. EBR Enforcer drops from the MG commandos in the Edge. But if you can manage that area, you can get the Overwhelmer which is top tier and will see you to the end of the game. Dealbreaker is too late game to be useful unless you plan for it as a replacement to your MG1000 in a MG build. 

The issue with feeling underwhelming comes from either a poor build or being underleveled with poor skill, aug and/or armour choices. The Edge at level 20 (X-30/40 armour) is quite a tough (but manageable) place but at level 30 (X-50/60 armour) is a breeze.

"I'd played The Ascent on release and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Not sure what you were expecting. There were bugs back then, but far and few, and nothing that ruined the experience for sure. My biggest draw to this game initially, was that I could couch co-op, but I ended up playing alone and finishing as I couldn't sync schedules with my co-op buddy.

The game is finished. Just the base game, is the complete story. You start your life as an indent, and you no longer are one.

Like that's the whole game. The combat is fun, the setting is gorgeous, and the music is pure cyberpunk bliss.

I'm not sure what you mean by - is there still development on the game ?

Do you mean like bug fixes ? or like more content ?

Content has been added into the game over time, like photomode, transmog etc. But what else do you add into a story experience ? There was a story DLC, that I didn't quite go through, as I was already playing other stuff, but I've no regrets getting the game at full price. Its a roughly 30 hour long game, with not much replayability value. 

Nothing about this game really strikes me as unfinished. There probably was some content cut from it, as it is, in every project, but that's just - like you said - business. Even Elden Ring, with its massive world, has content that is cut.

&lt;p&gt;People seem to be offended by just mentioning this part. I just think it&amp;#39;s a little ridiculous to turn a blind eye to all this in the name of a small studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still admire the inventiveness of the producers, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s a vague endorsement. I have nothing personal against the developers.&lt;/p&gt;

"First time I finished the DLC on PS5 it did get stuck on 'building game' mode.  I reset the console and it started (I think) at the gate before the start of the military base battle.  But I got turned off and didn't proceed.

What I did instead was just start all over again with a new game.  I was underpowered and underupgraded anyway in my first try on the DLC so I made sure I've got everything (pocket mech, the dragon aug, etc.) when I reach it.  Didn't crash or anything after I finished it. Yey!  Finished it a level 35.  Ferried back to Cluster 13 at this level and didn't experience any bugs.

But next day, I decided to start as a new indent for my 3rd playthru.  Will try and just concentrate on shotguns and sidearms.  So far I'm failing cuz I'm realizing I'll need the energy excessives for the spider mech battles.

Only a few days in, loving the indentured servitude, eating from bins in the afterglow of neon, but i've stumbled on something that spooked me early on. 

Ran the 1st mission, grabbing whatever I could. Accepted an invite the next day from my brother who was introducing himself to the ferals. It overwrote my infant character &amp; I had to start alongside him, from scratch.

 I've now got my guy up at lvl15, guns &amp; gadgets for days &amp; i'm scared to co-op. Is there a risk i'll lose everything, or was that purely because he was on the intro?

"First of all, congrats on finally beating it. I agree it is problematic and I blame the game design for this, and here is why.

Megarachnid is the first robotic boss, and the player is supposed to use an energy weapon against it because it deals bonus damage against robotic enemies while ballistic deal reduced damage against them.

The problem is, before the boss fight, the only energy weapon available in the shop is an energy pistol. And 99% of the enemies before this boss is organic. There are simply zero hints as to how important the pistol is later in the game. Many players will simply ignore it, not to mention upgrade it.

There is also an energy assault rifle that may drop from bots, who show up right before the boss fight. Again, there are zero hints as to how important this rifle is and I bet no one will think of going back to Cluster 13 immediately to upgrade the weapon without knowing there is a boss fight shortly after that requires the use of a good energy weapon.",,theascent,r/theascent,2023-01-04T01:45:45.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, congrats on finally beating it.

"Everything about it sucks.

The arena is tiny and poorly aligned, so half the time in shooting down at something I can't see.

It's basically impossible to avoid most damage. I have the best armour I've got with the highest fire resistance (about 100 total) and 2 1/2 health bars and I get melted in seconds. Dodging seems to do nothing, I use all 3 of my dodges to try and dodge past the spider and I'm getting cooked the entire time.

I'm spending so much time trying to shoot the smaller spiders, which seem to never stop, I don't get a chance to shoot the big one. So inevitably it comes out of nowhere and melts me after a short while. If I stop to hack the eggs, I get cooked before it has any effect.

I have the energy pistol up to mk 4, a monobot which seems to last about 3 seconds before getting destroyed so isn't much use and the EMP grenade.

Short of getting taxi out, grinding for components to upgrade my weapons and levelling up to increase my health, I have no idea how the fuck I'm supposed to beat this.

I was enjoying the game a hell of a lot, this boss fight is needlessly shit. I'm at about 30 tries now and thinking of just uninstalling the game a moving on with my life.

Update: After leaving, doing some sidequests and exploration and levelling up a few times I now have the E77 energy assault rifle up to Mk7, the I/O Converter augment and about twice as much fire protection as I had before.

This fight is still completely ridiculous. The fire still rips my health apart, the rifle does tiny chips of damage to the big spider which only seem to be slightly increased by the I/O augment. Hacking the eggs just blows them up before I can dodge away.

Even with as much grinding as anyone would realistically do, this boss is still unnecessarily hard.

"It's really inconsistent. I'm mowing through enemies a few levels above me out in the world but boss fights are so difficult to survive. You seem to need very specific gear and tactics to even have a chance, which is counter to all the options the game gives you. 

I agree it's designed for co-op with how much shit they throw at you sometimes. I'm not sure if it scales up when there's more players but it sure doesn't seem to scale down for solo.

The Data Miner mission was another brick wall for me. There's a trick though.

Get geared up with armour that has good energy resistance, the most powerful gun you have, spiderbots and the falcon punch augment. Also the health regen tactical if you have it.

As soon as the fight starts, head to the left or right of the console you just used. There are little areas down some steps. Stand there, gold the Aim button down and mow away. 90% of the enemies can't shoot you unless they come down the stairs, which they won't because you kill them before they get there. Some enemies will jump you, falcon punch them away. If you get overwhelmed, dash over to the other little area and repeat. Use spiderbots and the regen tactical as required.

I was getting destroyed on this part, did the above and beat it first go.

My only 2 solutions are getting a refund but I&amp;#39;m scared that Sony will make it difficult or buy a PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

"Fucking boring.

I heard so many good things about this game, I love rpgs, shooters, and I'm not even against the top-down perspective. But goddamn is this game a fucking chore to slog through.

Bullet sponge enemies, enemies that spawn behind you, a terrible cover system, augmentations with no cosmetic effect at all, enemies not spawning, equipment that might make the ""hold a button and direction"" combat fun if it wasn't tied to one of the longest fucking cooldowns I've seen, and, if you die, no consequence! The enemies you killed will even stay dead for you!

To top that off the game expects me to care and help this asshole deal with problems I don't care about in a world that's been barely established for me, I've been given no agency over my own character.

I played through the intro of it and got so bored with it all I had to shut it down and take a break to play something actually engaging. I went back the next day thinking ""this has to get better, there's no way THIS is what people are talking about"" and cleared the gang-infested area for poone (great name btw). After that, he gave me my next story quest and i just thought ""fuck this guy, fuck this game, fuck this world, i don't even care anymore""

Is this a me thing? Does it get better or is this just not a game for me?

Edit: Just want to clarify since some people seem to be getting the wrong idea, I'm not angry with the game. I was disappointed. And since I spent money on it, I was just trying to see if it was just a part I had to sit through before the game picks up, or if I had wasted money on something I probably just won't end up liking.

Judging by what everyone's saying it probably won't be worth my time to force myself in the hopes I find something I like.

"I actually enjoyed helldivers a lot! I generally enjoy twin-stick shooters as well. This, from what I saw and heard, seemed like a twin-stick shooter with RPG elements and a cyberpunk aesthetic (which is something I also enjoy). Honestly I wasn't expecting an open world map and thought it would follow a level-based structure like a lot of other twin-stck shooters, but was pleasantly surprised.

It's just that the combat doesn't feel anywhere near as satisfying as helldivers, the world setting seems interesting but I have no personal character motivation (corps are coming to carve up our arcology. OK, let them. My character seems to have no personal ties and hates his boss so... fuck 'em. Why am I still following orders instead of looting and escaping?), and enemies spawning behind me is something I would be used to in a twin-stck that 1. Doesn't expect me to be using a cover system as most just don't have one for a reason or 2. Has a level based system that doesn't lend itself to clearing one room at a time like the current open world system they have. 

The main thing that made me lose hope that I would ever enjoy the game though was the fact that, when I die, I face no consequence. I don't lose anything, I'm respawned almost exactly next to where I was, and everything I killed is still dead. So why am I even playing?

"A few things here:

* What you are describing as early versions of a game on gamepass was Microsoft was attracting a lot of developers with Early Access builds of games, in exactly the same vain as Valve does with Steam. Developers would time their contracts with MS to expire just around the time they aimed for a full product launch, which of course you then had to pay for if you wanted to continue to play. That is what people were moaning about

* There are no different builds of games on gamepass vs any other area of the MS ecosystem, GP is little more than a timed DRM system.

* As for The Ascent, I have played through this game multiple times and yes there are stupid bugs that keep popping up. The worst of them are always client side based for coop play - SP mode and coop Host doesn't suffer much. I've played this game on Series X, Windows Store PC, and PS5 now and by far I find the PS5 version to be the most buggy of the three so I wouldn't recommend changing.

"I've noticed so many references, inspirations, and Easter eggs in The Ascent, I'm wondering how many they packed into this dense world.

The main inspiration has to be Gibson's Sprawl trilogy (Neuromancer).  The corporate structure and all the lingo is pulled straight from the pages of those books.  ""Black ICE"", ""Arcology"", ""cyberdeck"", etc.

Visually Blade Runner seems to be the biggest inspiration for the city.  There are so many clear callbacks to both movies.  The most obvious is the prison building where you get the side mission about the riot.  I also noticed the umbrella lights everywhere.

Then there seems to be a heavy influence from Judge Dredd, especially the gang warfare and the huge stacks of apartments.  Visually the design of many of the buildings in the Warrens level seem to pay homage to the 2012 movie.

The Star Wars movies show up influencing some of the space ship designs, and the famous Cantina scene from Episode IV definitely influences the commerce sections.  Also the scenes of Coruscant seem to have inspired the traffic around the Arcology.  Deep Stink seems to take inspiration from garbage compactor on the Death Star.

Definitely influence from the Robocop movies with the mech designs.

Thematically there's obvious similarities with the Shadowrun and Cyberpunk 2077 franchises, but I didn't notice any specific references.

I also detected a whiff of 90's Anime especially Ghost in the Shell, but I'm not well versed in the genre so not sure how deep that goes.

&lt;p&gt;The Star Wars movies show up influencing some of the space ship designs, and the famous Cantina scene from Episode IV definitely influences the commerce sections.  Also the scenes of Coruscant seem to have inspired the traffic around the Arcology.  Deep Stink seems to take inspiration from garbage compactor on the Death Star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely influence from the Robocop movies with the mech designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thematically there&amp;#39;s obvious similarities with the Shadowrun and Cyberpunk 2077 franchises, but I didn&amp;#39;t notice any specific references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also detected a whiff of 90&amp;#39;s Anime especially Ghost in the Shell, but I&amp;#39;m not well versed in the genre so not sure how deep that goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My memory is already fading from my playthrough, I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m forgetting half of them.  What else is there?&lt;/p&gt;

"I bought the DLC right after it came out but could not get into it due to the exact same reasons you posted above. I was running mostly the RPG gun (fully upgraded) with I/O converter + the ability that slams what is infront of you (forgot its name) + the pocket mech. I  would keep spamming rockets from the distance, then putting out the mech once it is available, then rinse and repeat. That was a total slog in the DLC and at some point I could not progress, so I kind of stopped playing the game. I think it did not help that I was playing on hard and without aim assist (then again I am not sure if the 'easy' of the DLC is really 'easy')

2-3 days ago I decided to give it another go and after experimenting I found that for the DLC you really have to change your build and adapt to the new waves of very strong enemies. I spent the 260k to respec the build to be more melee-friendly and started running with the two swords (voidcutter and guillotine) + overclock + the dome that protects you from projectiles + the healing pylon ability. This build shreds \*everything\* on hard with no aim assist...and I had lots of fun with it.

The other poster's idea with the spider bots also sounds cool - my point is that you need to change things and experiment and you will find your fun and groove again with the DLC.  Once I changed my build the enemies were not bullet sponges anymore compared to the DPS beast my character became. I managed to finish the DLC (with its 3 side missions and every chest) in almost one sitting.

If you liked the main game, the DLC is really more of the same - with some great vistas and 1-2 funny side missions (even if overall the story is very shallow)

Another thing that works (if you prefer guns) is the dealbreaker + overclock + lifesteal or the metal hands that come out of the floor to slam the enemies.

I am sure there are many other builds that are viable too, just be open to experiment!

"I kind of agree and disagree with u/turtlemancity at the same time.

Overwhelmer is an end-game weapon for sure, but not because of its damage. In fact, 400+ DPS plus 20-round magazines are pathetic in the end game. For instance, MG1000, a mid-game minigun deals 1k+ DPS, although it has a huge spread, but so as Overwhelmer.

This is something I have yet to understand why people thinks it is a wonderful primary weapon. Even the game lore itself seems to glorify Overwhlmer as the ultimate weapon of some sort.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I use it as a secondary weapon, just to deal with shielded enemies. Remember those frontal shields that block every single bullet? Guess what? Overwhelmer deals AOE damage, so it basically ignores the shields.

"First off i can't believe this is made by a team of 11. Its definitely a visual marvel on this scale. The cyberpunk visuals alone is worth the price for any sci-fic fan out there. Its the closest you gonna get for a Star Wars 1313 type setting. Im just gonna break it down to a good and bad thing in dot form because the deputy likes dots

&amp;#x200B;

THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

&amp;#x200B;

* The Cyberpunk setting and its backstory, its just so immersive and lore friendly. Nothing feels edgy or out of place (unlike a recent game of a similar theme) and it constantly reminds you of the interpretation of ""high tech low life"". It feels like a mash of Bladerunner and Shadowrun in a very unique way. A travesty if The Ascent isnt further expanded on future narratives.
* The Graphics. Kinda spoils my expectation of indie devs tbh. Great, now i expect more from other indie games
* The Gameplay, It feels so satisfying mowing down mobs with a combination of weapon types, ultilities and augments. Its nothing groundbreaking for a twinstick shooter but it does what its suppose to and it does it very well. Though it can feel a little janky when you first jump into it not fully understanding how the weapon and movement system functions.
* The Sounds. Guns feel punchy and impactful. Old school techno, industrial and ambient music for electronic music lovers. Its Pawel Blaszczak, the guy behind Dying Light. Its got to be the title screen music.
* Hard can be real challenging especially first time encounters with bosses, one time i was fighting a mech boss with flame attacks and i was ill prepared with fire weapons and 0 resistance, had to lick my wounds and backtrack to town and get myself some proper gear and just like that the fight outcome turned 180 for me.
* Many games out there lack enemy type, Ascent isn't one of them

&amp;#x200B;

NEEEEDS TO BE IMPROVED!

&amp;#x200B;

* The player character and his/her story. Ah yes im just an errand boy. do ya job and dont even try asking why boy.
* Stats are not very well explained, had to figure it out by reading it online and watching youtube.
* Map is very confusing at times, can't really tell where the elevation is. Stairs and elevators should be marked on the map
* Lots and i do mean LOTS of backtracking early game, not exactly a hard con for me as i love exploring but it kinda turn my friend off.
* territories with way stronger enemies are not properly demarcated makes it so easy for a low level that wander off into the wrong direction (which you will) and by the time you even get a good look at them, you end up getting smeared all over the floor.
* Don't expect much varieties in the quests, its your typical run of the mill fetch quest and wave defense
* Final mission (Ú¦ãê) is all wave after wave after wave, yea... very original, wth??  I really enjoy the game to its core until this final confrontation which i couldn't believe it..

&amp;#x200B;

THE CO-OP (A BUGGY HELL!!!)

&amp;#x200B;

* i've gathered couple of my friends to visit the Archology once again. There are..... lots of bugs.... freakin infestation is what i call it. Gamebreaking ones like first boss not spawning, getting stuck in the merc vendor screen, one of us getting a black screen with ui after a cutscene (this one persist even after a reload, had to do a hard reset + lots of prayers) and loading into a game naked (quite literally) have to reequip everything. Thats a bad start... And there are minor annoying ones like health bar/ui dissapearing and what drives me bonkers or as they say the final insect pin in the acrylic coffers is the optimization for co-op where we get crashes so often that we had to give up and go play something else. 
* I think ive said my piece here as Co-Op generally are fun with friends even in bad games and yes we did manage to complete it in co-op but with plenty of resentment.
* Thankfully these killer bugs are contained only in Co-Op. In fact i dont think i recall any bugs at all in solo play.

Overall despite its annoying flaws and co-op grievance,  its still a piece of art and definitely gets my seal of approval as to everything else this game has to offer which manage to keep us going back for more!",,,r/theascent,2022-12-07T00:09:51.000Z,post,,,Discussion,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off i can&amp;#39;t believe this is made by a team of 11.

&lt;li&gt;Stats are not very well explained, had to figure it out by reading it online and watching youtube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map is very confusing at times, can&amp;#39;t really tell where the elevation is. Stairs and elevators should be marked on the map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots and i do mean LOTS of backtracking early game, not exactly a hard con for me as i love exploring but it kinda turn my friend off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;territories with way stronger enemies are not properly demarcated makes it so easy for a low level that wander off into the wrong direction (which you will) and by the time you even get a good look at them, you end up getting smeared all over the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t expect much varieties in the quests, its your typical run of the mill fetch quest and wave defense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final mission (Ú¦ãê) is all wave after wave after wave, yea... very original, wth??  I really enjoy the game to its core until this final confrontation which i couldn&amp;#39;t believe it..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE CO-OP (A BUGGY HELL!!!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&amp;#39;ve gathered couple of my friends to visit the Archology once again. There are..... lots of bugs.... freakin infestation is what i call it. Gamebreaking ones like first boss not spawning, getting stuck in the merc vendor screen, one of us getting a black screen with ui after a cutscene (this one persist even after a reload, had to do a hard reset + lots of prayers) and loading into a game naked (quite literally) have to reequip everything. Thats a bad start... And there are minor annoying ones like health bar/ui dissapearing and what drives me bonkers or as they say the final insect pin in the acrylic coffers is the optimization for co-op where we get crashes so often that we had to give up and go play something else. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think ive said my piece here as Co-Op generally are fun with friends even in bad games and yes we did manage to complete it in co-op but with plenty of resentment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thankfully these killer bugs are contained only in Co-Op. In fact i dont think i recall any bugs at all in solo play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall despite its annoying flaws and co-op grievance,  its still a piece of art and definitely gets my seal of approval as to everything else this game has to offer which manage to keep us going back for more!&lt;/p&gt;

"I've seen some on here state they have had no issues with this game. I'm happy for them, and hope for anyone that purchases the game that's the experience they have. With that said, that IS NOT how my time with The Ascent has gone.

My experience has been buggy to the point of it being unplayable. The Ascent has had more glitches and quest breaking bugs than every game I've played in the last 5 years combined. It is absolutely absurd the amount of times NPCs, quest objects and markers failed to load properly forcing me to quit and reload. This last bug is what finally drove me to outright delete this game off my system.

I'm following my quest pathfinder and reach my destination for a drop-off. I can see on the mini-map that I'm directly on top of where I need to be. After running around the area for 10 minutes, trying to reach the objective on different levels and still unable to locate the person I was supposed to meet, I figure once again the NPC has failed to load (this would be the 4th time during my playthrough I can remember). So I quit and reload. My game loads back up and I have no idea where I'm at. It's at a completely random spot on the map. I press up on the D-pad to trigger the quest pathfinder, and it no longer works. I open my menu and the quest beacon is nowhere to be seen. I try toggling between quests to see if I can fix it, no luck. I quit and reload back into the same spot. Quest pathfinder still doesn't work so I try to doing it by using clues from the quest log on where to go. I eventually find the spot again, but no one is there, nothing is triggered. Quit and reload, pathfinder actually works again. I once again make the trek to where I need to be and nothing. No one is there, no cutscene triggers, nothing. That was the final straw, and for the first time I can remember I deleted a game because IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK.

Had I gotten this game for free I would have been mad simply for how much of my time it wasted.

"I think I'm near the end of the game, and I have a few weapons I always fall back to, I just keep finding myself wishing weapon customization was a little more fleshed out to alter weapons. Or even just more weapons in general.

Maybe weapon attributes? Say you find a Dread with +5 Biometrics, +7 Cybernetics, -3 Frame.

Or maybe a MG1000 with +15% movement speed while ADS. Idk. Might extend game lifetime farming equipment with different stats for different setups. I have a few skills maxed and Crit is one of them, and tbh, you don't exactly Crit much.

I know armor has its own attributes but how about random attributes...find you a deep stink rebreather that's got a God roll for stuff...lol

Just ideas because some of these guns....Just....suck lol I found a named smg that has ricochet rounds....you wind up hurting yourself...a dismember I think it's called, shoots saw blades...would be dope if it did Bleed damage...because tbh that thing is lacking. Never really found a use for the minigun, ballistic or energy, because you can get your rectum pushed in so quickly by enemies no matter what armor you wear.

"This is a terrible argument. Some of the best games I¡¯ve played was by an indie studio or even less people. Some of the best games on the market was made by a small group of people.  This is not one of them.

Bad game design is bad game design.  

It¡¯s incredible the graphical polish and fidelity a small team was able to make, but many of the game design choices are questionable at best.  Incredible graphics do NOT make a great game and this game is a perfect example of that.  

Anyone who disagrees i honestly think are either a casual gamer or too young to truly dissect a game properly. Judging by the ¡°it¡¯s a small studio¡± irrelevancy, I will assume the latter

"Just to elaborate on this answer a bit, this is mostly correct but if you are exploring regularly, and walking everywhere instead of fast traveling, you should have a decent supply of components by end game to have upgraded 8-9 weapons to at least MK8. MK9/10 require Superior components which are finite. Make sure you are always killing bounties when they pop up because they always drop a basic, advanced or both. Same with the mechs.

There is an awesome farming spot though that will give you guaranteed 2 basic + 2 advanced every kill though if you want to put the time in. The second time you return to DNexus, and the very east side of the level opens up, there are two perpetually respawning spider droids there, each will always drop a matching set. You can melt them with IO Convert+Lockon Fire+Dealbreaker in a couple seconds flat (or a little longer if you want to use Strikebreaker/Strobos/Dominator, whatever is upgraded the most).

"&gt;that when a multiplayer game is started on Xbox the game server is running on the cloud and both the players join that server?

I don't think that's how it works but I don't know for sure

I think it's played on the xbox's, uses Xbox live to connect the games to each other, and is hosted by the party leader, basically like you described the PS connection

I'm not very familiar with how the cloud works for the Xbox live other than a little info on save games (and just woke up), but I think it's not through the cloud as much unless you're playing through cloud gaming which means you don't have the game installed and have to connect to the cloud server for the game to play it

"you need to max out
Vital signs
Body battery 
Tactical sense. 
Those are the most critical. 

For your tactical:
Rejuvenation field.  When you get low, pop smoke and replenish ur health.

Aug 1 I got spider bots. You can pick urs but this was always what gets me out of a bad spot

Aug 2 Life Transfer (this changes the game) you pop this thing and every time you hit an enemy, that damage gets added to your health bar. The more damage u dish out the more health gets added immediately.  This is the big one.  If you max ur battery and tactical sense this is even more powerful.   With this u will be able to beat the game solo.  

Mod 1 Vitasigns Booster

Mod 2 speedheal 

For weapons: 
I love my Level 10 protector pistol.  It¡¯s a real nail driver and really satisfying to shoot.

For energy weapon I use the enforcer or disintegrator if you have that.  Level those up.

"Awful. Forced myself to put up with it, new game + and stuck on first boss with access denied. There is a thread about it a year old - still not fixed. It why I came here, to share how messed up this game STILL is. That said, never missed any items at least. I would have totally given up if they didn't at least fix that in the early days.

11900k, 3090 ti, 4k. Dx12 is complete trash, DLSS is trash and causes major distortion at times (tbh, dlss is trash in every game) and RTX totally off. Still get massive frame dips occasionally but not as bad on dx11. DX11 looks and plays MUCH better and you have to turn everything else off. Every other setting is ultra and it usually sits above 110 fps, but goes anywhere from 70-144 randomly. It also uses the most wattage I have ever seen from any game. For no good reason, especially forcing dx11.

Constant issues during first playthrough and what most people are leaving out is the broken quests and lack of detail on where to find them. I downloaded the DLC and had to hunt for the locations to start the side quests. They just kind of threw a sort of secret taxi spot in randomly on the map but the side quests are all over the place and you won't find them easily. They don't appear until you k ow exactly where to go and are already inside a specific location. Just dumb.

Even if it ""runs smoothly"" for people (I feel they are just ignoring issues or don't notice them), the game is a mess. Map is awful, no waypoints, no clear directions on progression and tons of exploring only to find out you can't access certain parts until later and that is how you miss side quests then have to hunt for them once it's all over. I resulted to a couple lists to find quests I was missing before finally stumbling across a 100% guide on steam. Totally by accident. Even still, it's a mess. 

The devs have their heads up their butts here. People need to stop sugar coating it. You will run into issues, especially on PC. So much potential, and it is a fun game, but with all the bugs and such, I would absolutely not recommend it unless you get everything for maybe $10 - including DLC. Apparently consoles run better, probably because they are forced dx11, low(er) fps (no offense), and got more support before they abandoned this game.

"First time was tough, I remember.
Dont know if it fits your playstyle, but I can tell you what I did:
Take the Mono defender and Rat Bite as Augs. Mono will help to draw some attention if you are 
near the turrets or some heavies are around. Rat Bite will be perfect with all these suckers if you are completely surrounded. Got a lot of allies? Then its time to get to the turrets and go trough them one by one. Always stay in the back and dont get close. Also, shoot the turrets from outside their range. Especially if you dont have any Ferrals with Rat Bite anymore. - You can still damage turrets, even if you cant see them on your screen.
On the Weapon side, you said you used a Minigun? Its tempting with all the ferrals and if its your best weapon then I would definitely use it for shooting turrets from afar and those first ferrals running at you. But as soon as you got some close action- Dominator or hopefully Overwhelmer at this point, should definitely help you clear the waves faster and with less damage.

I know this was a really tough spot, especially if you normally go in, mow everything down, rinse and repeat. But playing it cautious really did it for me on this particular spot!

"So, I really like this game. I have almost 30 hours into it. I've gotten quite far. Had some issues with it crashing but it was always a minor inconvenience. Until now.

I just finished retrieving the Snooze shipment from the Cosmodrome and was on my way back when the game froze and crashed to desktop. Now, whenever I try to launch the game it brings up the splash screen briefly and then just immediately crashes and I'm unable to play at all anymore. I've tried verifying the integrity of local files (I'm playing the Steam version of the game) and it says nothing is wrong.

Does anyone know how to get around this? Is all my progress lost?

I keep getting this error when it crashes:

EDIT: Well, I found a video on youtube about how to fix this issue. I've updated my BIOS and my GPU drivers. I set the game to launch with -dx11 launch option and it launched. I removed the -dx11 launch option and it is still launching. I still have my progress. I guess this issue is solved for now.",,,r/theascent,2022-11-12T06:32:48.000Z,post,,,Bug,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I really like this game. I have almost 30 hours into it. I&amp;#39;ve gotten quite far. Had some issues with it crashing but it was always a minor inconvenience. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished retrieving the Snooze shipment from the Cosmodrome and was on my way back when the game froze and crashed to desktop. Now, whenever I try to launch the game it brings up the splash screen briefly and then just immediately crashes and I&amp;#39;m unable to play at all anymore. I&amp;#39;ve tried verifying the integrity of local files (I&amp;#39;m playing the Steam version of the game) and it says nothing is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know how to get around this? Is all my progress lost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep getting this error when it crashes:&lt;/p&gt;

"Helldivers is a meta war game, where the entire player base is engaged in war based on cycles. The community participation from all platforms determines whether they win or lose a given cycle, while fighting a war on three fronts at the same time. Each conflict planet is randomly generated, but it's design persists for the given war cycle. At the end of the cycle - humanity either wins or loses, the meta war resets and the a new war begins with new planets generated for that wars. Cycles have been blitzed through in a few days, or gone on for weeks at a time, entirely based on the tug a war of the playerbase.

As for RPG mechanics, they are light but extensive. There are three tiers of objectives.

1) XP based unlocks - both weapons and cosmetics for your character unlock from levels 1 through 30, and then a final vanity set unlocked at level 50 which is the cap.

2) Planet based unlocks - each planet will show you a specific ""strategem"" reward for finishing all the missions on that planet.

3) Upgrade tokens - rewarded for every rank received, as well as farming collectable ""science samples"" on every mission. By far the most time consuming aspect of the game, it's a long grind if you want to max everything out.

Helldivers is one of my favourite games of all time, and has much much replay value than the ascent IMO. Cannot wait for the sequel to come out that's been teased through leaks. Helldivers is one of those games that's easy to pickup, but very tough to master. There is extreme high level play in that game, that once you have a taste of the mechanics you would appreciate when you see it. It's at it's absolute best with a full squad on the high difficulty tiers. Please note,  the original difficulty of the game ranged from planet grades 1 through 12, with 12 being a tough but fair challenge. Years later they added three more difficulties for the elite crazy players who wanted a very tough challenge, 13 through 15 - so stay clear of that initially.",,theascent,r/theascent,2022-10-30T20:04:30.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helldivers is a meta war game, where the entire player base is engaged in war based on cycles.

"First of all: congratulations to the devs, your game is awesome and stunningly beautiful. The details in the huge environments, the atmosphere, the characterization of the world, all top notch perfectly executed stuff.

Now on to the chonky writeabaout.

As the title says, I have just finished the game and the DLC, and by that I mean truly 100%ed it: found all skins, done all missions, collected all weapons, armor pieces, augments, mods, EVERYTHING.

My independent contractor is at LV37, has his favourite weapons at Mk10 and something like 25-30 bounties to turn in left, and over 2 Mil credits on his bank account.

This small bit of brag is to make clear that I have run the game through in its absolute entirety...and while I massively enjoyed it because it's a cyberpunk Diablo-esque ARPG/twinstick shooter hybrid, damn do I have some serious complaints about it.

Main among all THE BUGS. The game is quite a mess of bugs be them small or downright gamebreaking. 

Example of a small one? Loot gets shot out of bound or somewhere unreachable. 

Example of a big one? Zell can get stuck in his shield phase making the de facto final boss fight of the game locked unless one does reload the whole game and starts it all again. IT HAPPENED THRICE, HOLY CEO OF MALHORST-GELB.

This game needs some serious polishing from the technical POV. Also, another nasty bug is that sometimes  certain visual effects (can't still determine which ones precisely because there's always a total mess on my screen) can apparently brick the game and require a reboot of the whole computer. It goes from 60fps smooth to unresponsive.

Now, on to other stuff.

The armor styles are great, but every tier (except the last) is basically a repurposition of slightly tweaked armor pieces from the previous tiers, making variety scarce until one does hit the gold/purple tiers.

Weapons: I love the variety of tools we get to spread mayhem across the arcology, but why have 4 damage types when the weapons only have 3?? I know about Bitsplit (which I don't have as it was a preorder bonus apparently) and the IO Converter...but if you decide to throw hordes of robots tough as bricks at the player multiple times you should also provide the players with tools to overcome said hordes (dNexus/rezDEV/adminArea PTSD kicking in hard here).

INFINITE SPAWNS are bullshit. The Deepstink, especially the Silo86, is probably the worst area in the game as it gets flooded with ferals of all kinds AND THEN it gets flooded with an infinite spawn of Papa Ferals, ferals and there are two fortified sniper/mortar entrenchments to top it all.

Also, why are quite some gates in the Deepstink permanently closed (access denied) when I can literally shred through megacorps encryptions and military tech?! The Ghost of Veles can operate a single handed reboot of a sentient self-concious artificial intelligence with an IMP, but can't open a couple damn doors in the bloody sewers...and this makes navigating that area a true boring experience, made of tedious infinite ferals and time lost.

About the loss of time, why are holophones and informatics used so sparsely?!?!?! The game has a ton of fetch quests, be them main line or subsidiaries, and often the thing to fetch isn't material but data, virtual coins, info and such...why can't we communicate at distance when we can literally back up and send an AGI program via remote? Or better why can't we use those holophones and/or the commlinks that often get used in the same missions, requiring us to traverse the labyrinth of the arcology, to bring immaterial goods around or just get remote paid after a mission??


Despite all of this, I enjoyed the game. It could be much more and much better, it has its really highs and real lows, but it's been a great experience and a genuinely fun murderous romp in one of the best game settings I've ever explored.

The Ghost of Veles can operate a single handed reboot of a sentient self-concious artificial intelligence with an IMP, but can&amp;#39;t open a couple damn doors in the bloody sewers...and this makes navigating that area a true boring experience, made of tedious infinite ferals and time lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the loss of time, why are holophones and informatics used so sparsely?!?!?! The game has a ton of fetch quests, be them main line or subsidiaries, and often the thing to fetch isn&amp;#39;t material but data, virtual coins, info and such...why can&amp;#39;t we communicate at distance when we can literally back up and send an AGI program via remote? Or better why can&amp;#39;t we use those holophones and/or the commlinks that often get used in the same missions, requiring us to traverse the labyrinth of the arcology, to bring immaterial goods around or just get remote paid after a mission??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, I enjoyed the game. It could be much more and much better, it has its really highs and real lows, but it&amp;#39;s been a great experience and a genuinely fun murderous romp in one of the best game settings I&amp;#39;ve ever explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got here, thanks for having read it all and cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

"Wolcen was definitely one of my biggest gaming let downs, and you brought back to me a lot of deep buried anger regarding it.

Regarding the modules' system...meh it was ok, all modules could be farmed from different sources (Basic/Advanced from bounties and enemy Monos, Advanced/Superior from Siege Mechs which were granted to spawn  in selected spots on the Highstreet tier and the Dark Playground tier). I managed to Mk10 at least 8 weapons with loads of other weapons sitting at Mk1-6 because either they were made obsolete by other weapons or just because I got them for the sake of completionism.
But yeah, scaling was most of the times completely absent if not minimal.

Dodge animations, I saw them only a few times as I immediatley started using the Javelin Dash aug as soon as I got it, so I zip-zapped across the game for 99% of my time.

About skills, yeah I feel that. I maxed out HP/AP, Dodge, Aim (useful when using high spread weapons, and I mained the Overwhelmer for the last 2/3 of the game...so it was quite useful) and Reload. That's it, the other stuff I saw it as useless skill dumps.

The redundancy of weapons is evident, especially when your run of the mill endgame enemies still drop crap Habdefenders, Protectors, Dread and Riot Guns. Ranger Monos and Malhorst Gelb goons can drop the occasional E77 Superior...but it's honestly useless when you can shoot with much better stuff at that point. Although I liked the variety of firing modes differentiating the weapons, that was fun: burst, full auto, homing, single shot, flamethrower, beam, pellets, explosive, bouncing, sawblades...that was great and propelled me further into wanting ALL weapons.

Hidden shops, I found maybe 5 of them across the whole game? From memory, one is in the Golden Satori (sells the Magmamaker, the only flamethrower in game), another secret weapon merchant is somewhere near the Ascent building in RezDev, a Chromedoc in the bowels of the Silo86, a Tech in the Hackers Lair in Blacklake, and another Tech merchant somewhere else but can't remember where. All of them (except the Chromedoc) offer a single or a couple unique items for sale, and of course work as buyers for your surplus stuff.

For healing I learnt that there are some augments that can work as ""field meds"", and one of them, the one that heals you on damage dealt to marked targets, is absolutely recommended (if not straight out required) to beat the final fight of the DLC against MG Security Chief Zell, as he and his skull guards and generic ads are going to shred you immediately unless you out-heal their damage.

Last, I had no savegame deletion instances (luckily) but damn I'm not surprised to hear that it's an issue with the game as I had a fair share of the full magnitude range of bugs riddling this game.

Although I liked the variety of firing modes differentiating the weapons, that was fun: burst, full auto, homing, single shot, flamethrower, beam, pellets, explosive, bouncing, sawblades...that was great and propelled me further into wanting ALL weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hidden shops, I found maybe 5 of them across the whole game? From memory, one is in the Golden Satori (sells the Magmamaker, the only flamethrower in game), another secret weapon merchant is somewhere near the Ascent building in RezDev, a Chromedoc in the bowels of the Silo86, a Tech in the Hackers Lair in Blacklake, and another Tech merchant somewhere else but can&amp;#39;t remember where. All of them (except the Chromedoc) offer a single or a couple unique items for sale, and of course work as buyers for your surplus stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For healing I learnt that there are some augments that can work as &amp;quot;field meds&amp;quot;, and one of them, the one that heals you on damage dealt to marked targets, is absolutely recommended (if not straight out required) to beat the final fight of the DLC against MG Security Chief Zell, as he and his skull guards and generic ads are going to shred you immediately unless you out-heal their damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, I had no savegame deletion instances (luckily) but damn I&amp;#39;m not surprised to hear that it&amp;#39;s an issue with the game as I had a fair share of the full magnitude range of bugs riddling this game. There&amp;#39;s a lot of work left to do with this product.&lt;/p&gt;

"First off, where are they pulling these rounds per second stats from? Space? No possible way the single shot starting pistol, P1 protector, has the same rounds per second as the Dread, an assault rifle. Stat sheets say so, but not possible to make the P1 fire as fast as a Dread. Hand cannons have about 1 round per second. Maybe 1.5. Set a timer for 1 second and see if you can pop off 4 shots with the HVF Heat. Not gonna happen. None of these rounds per seconds are even close to actual fire rates. 

Which of course throws the Damage per second stat into chaos and tells us something that isnt there. Like my Mk 4 P1 Protector. 12 rounds a second, exactly the same rounds per second as the Dread assault rifle, on paper. So, on paper, the mk4 P1 has 472 dps. Which is a lie cause there is no way my mk4 P1 has double the dps a mk 4 dominator does. Dominator shows 7 rounds per second, almost half the P1, has 29-43 damager per shot. And has half the dps, 252, then the P1 Protector at 472 dps.  Theres just no way. 

At first i thought the red and green arrows might have been accurate to the proper nubers, but alas they are not. A mk1 Goliath can out dps a Dominator according to stats. When it gets 1 shot off in 1 second. Dominator could get a few rounds off in 1 second.

My dumb ass thought they actually end so I spent a good 15-20 minutes¡¦ trying to wipe out every single one . And I DID ! but as soon as I stepped into the range of the turrets , THEY ALL SPAWN- IN THE SAME AMOUNT . That¡¯s when I was like screw it and made a run for It. I barely made it and faced my first set of bots and got wrecked by the spider bot. &lt;/p&gt;

"It's the nature of sandbox games. Even if you have travel points all over a map, you're always going to have some distance that you have to walk to get to major story beats. They're never going to simply drop you off right at the point of a mission. Some traversal is always necessary. 

Besides, the creators of The Ascent put so much work into the art design that it's little wonder they'd want you to walk a bit and take in the scenery. Honestly for me, it took a very long time for things to start feeling old in the game because I thought the environment was just so alive visually.

"My #1 gripe with the game tbh, but you just gotta get used to it.

Might as well absorb the sights too while you're walking around.

I think it would also help if you somewhat memorize the routes of the trains as well as the nearby locations of the taxi spots.

I remember there was one part where I walked 800+m only to realize later on I could've just taken a taxi and reduced that down to 200.

"Hi!

I'm new here and just bought the game last week but have become incredibly addicted. I just started the DLC (assuming that this part is already the DLC content) and I've come across this chest room that's apparently inaccessible??? in the Harbor in Dark Playground.

It's hackable but there's definitely no door visible. Is there some new feature/skill that I'm still yet to obtain in my DLC playthrough that lets me access rooms like this? Quite confused.

I've also placed a map view in the second photo.

"I've just finished my first base game playthrough.

I saw a lot of viable builds online but so far I've felt the most awesome following the Ballistic/Energy bust rifles critical commando build.

for skills, I basically just prio maxxed crit, aiming, and handling, then secondary was evasion then vitals, then lastly tactical. I put occasional points into others but these crit, aiming, and handling are basically your main thangs.

For the armor, I don't really have a say. I just made sure I picked pieces with 2 or more boosts to attributes, but preferably the ones that boosts vital and energy. If they looked ugly together, the Stylist was my friend, hehe.

"I'm level 25, and have been enjoying the game, but I am stopped stone cold by the robots in the Scrapyard and the Recompile mission (which is supposed to be recommended level 21). I'm using Overwhelmer Mk 8, which has been great up until now, as has been the RPG 23 (also Mk 8). Neither of these really do any damage to the robots in Recompiler. I can use the RPG23 to take them down one at a time, but it takes 20-30 shots, which would be ok, if not tedious, but there are a few on me at once, not to mention a pair of area effect grenades constantly, so it's quite a struggle, and not a lot of fun. Once I get past them, and the set with turrets, I get to the pair of spiders, however, they spit out a constant stream of 8-10 little spiders, and I can't kill them fast enough to actually get any damage to the mother spider, which themselves, are barely damaged by anything I throw at it. I usually die pretty quickly to the mass of smaller spiders. There's just so many that once i have to reload, it is often the end. Same issue in the Scrapyard, except for side missions in the Scrapyard I can just run past things.

Really frustrated, and I have been stuck for a while. There has to be something I'm missing? I think I can get 1-2 weapons to Mk 9 or possibly Mk 10, but the way the game is set up, it is kind of hard to test weapons as there's not enough materials, and very limited high level materials, such that I am concerned about choosing the wrong thing to bring to Mk 10. Hesitate to think the jump to a Mk 10 weapon is going to make that much difference, when the Mk 8s I am using don't really do anything. Thinking of dropping the game because I am so frustrated, but short of that, any advice?

I'm using Biometric Timestamp and Life Transfer, as well as a Rejuv Field tactical grenade. You'd think that would help, but it gets overwhelmed by all this. Highest level 50 armor I can find in all slots. The issue seems to be I need a different weapon, because I don't struggle at all against human enemies. The robots have to have resistance to what I am trying to use? That has to be it. Hasn't been an issue - at all - until all of a sudden I can't kill these things, and I am at or above their level.

"When the difficulty spikes, swap up some stuff. So, if you¡¯re getting tore up by spider bots, look for gear that has better fire protection.

I ran through the main game with my wife many times, and I always kept one max ballistic and one max energy weapon (when I had the materials of course) and i always stayed with the dread, or the dominator, and the EBR. Keep a few different types of weapons in your inventory.

"I tried it. The EBR works well, but it still takes a lot of shots to take a robot down. Less though. Since it fires in bursts, it is 8-10 shots to take one of them down at Mk 8, and since it has a bit of delay between bursts, it can be problematic, but it is way better than the RPG23 I was trying before.

Same issue arises though: what do you do with the swarms of little spiders? One burst from the EBR kills one, but there's always at least 4-5 on screen no matter how fast I kill them, and I get one-hit killed if two of them detonate near me. Obviously, don't let that happen, is probably the answer, but I'm running around trying to land a shot on the mother spider, while killing baby spiders. Any mistake there letting a baby spider near me is instant death. If I focus only on the baby spiders, the mother spider sends out 8-10 of them every few seconds it seems like - fast enough to always have 4-5 of them around. I really don't understand this part. I was dying here before (only now I got here much easier, thanks to the EBR). I couldn't do this in the Scrapyard either, as there are two spiders there that do the same thing. What sucks is death punts you back to the start of the mission room. I can't upgrade HP or armor any higher - I have both as high as they'll go (at least with the gear I have - various PF50 and similar things).

Is upgrading the EBR to Mk 10 the best move? Commit to it? Better skill to never get hit by a baby spider I guess (I can't believe that if two get near me I am dead instantly from their explosion at 369 HP). It looks like they explode with an energy burst, even though clearly the mother spider has a fire attack. I have 134 defense against energy. I can raise it by 20 points if I fall down to 343 HP. I guess that's clearly the thing to do for armor and hope that I don't get one-hit KO'd anymore. I may have to go all-in on the EBR and retreat to the Scrapyard and fight the spiders there until I can kill both without dying.

I am really developing a strong dislike for this game now. It's not even that its hard. It is just unfair. Imho anyway.

Nevermind: I deleted the game. I don't want to play this anymore. I did kill one spider in the Scrapyard (yay!), but I died to some energy explosion at the same time. I was unable to keep my health over half for that fight, and I believe a single exploding baby spider killed me - and that was a fight against only one spider. It was too much , and there are two of them in that mission. I think this is proof of concept, that with a bit of practice I could kill one no problem, but I just honestly don't even care to try to kill two at the same time, given how this went, and who knows what the next difficulty spike will be. I don't need the aggravation! It isn't fun. I've had tons of fun in Souls, Nioh games, Elden Ring and somehow this game, I don't know.

"That sucks man. I honestly don¡¯t remember having many difficulty spikes myself, I played at launch all the way up through the DLC drop.

Never really had any problems. Now, I HAVE had to kite scores of enemies in circles as I cull them down. I roll and dodge a lot, and I utilize cover a lot. On bigger enemies, I aim high and shoot with the devastator, and it will temporarily stun them.

On the baby spiders, roll away from them just right and you don¡¯t even have to shoot them. They pounce and explode. So, as they are about to pounce, roll toward them, and away from where they are going to pounce. The blast won¡¯t hit you.

"Thanks! I was enjoying the challenge solo, up to the spiders, so was preferring to finish it solo. I hadn't considered baiting the baby spider leaps, but that would probably work. There's so many of them, from different angles in a small space in that mission, when there's two spiders, but it may be possible to engage one at a time or kill one quickly.

"Robots are ""vulnerable"" only to energy and digital damage. Using a ballistic/explosive weapon against them is completely ineffective.


Find yourself an energy weapon. I reccomend the eraser shotgun or the ebr enforcer.


Or you can use the I/O Converter augment to change the damage tipe of your weapons to digital so you can use your favourite ballistic weapons and still do damage to robots.


And in case you want to understand if an enemy is vulnerable to the current damage type you are dealing look at the damage numbers when you hit. If they are red it means the enemy has resitances to that damage. If they are grey the enemy does nkt resist that damage and if they are yellow and big that means you are critting.",,theascent,r/theascent,2022-09-25T19:55:22.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robots are &amp;quot;vulnerable&amp;quot; only to energy and digital damage.

"Yeah, but my concern with that is that it has a cooldown, so it has a duration of effect too. I was concerned it would be down when I really needed it. I guess it depends what the duration of effect is. I might try it if I pick the game up again at some point. Earlier in the game, vs the first boss spider, I was using the Dominator at that time I believe. The nice thing, being an automatic weapon, was that it burned through the baby spiders - a whole bunch of them in a burst - where the Enforcer, being a burst weapon, took out one at a time, per burst, which I think was where I was getting into trouble. I still did it, but it was only vs one and I died. I'm thinking now that using the Enforcer vs the robots, generally (since that was great), and the I/O Converter and the Dominator vs a spider may be the way to go. Maybe. Something to try.

"Be careful with that. There's a lingering bug that's been around since the game's release where it will randomly freeze and when you go back into the game, all of your gear has been deleted. Sometimes it affects your cyberdeck as well. Quite frankly, it might happen regardless of whether you go co-op or not. But the good news is that it only happens once. The game will still freeze on you from time to time, but it never does the gear deletion thing again. I've been playing now for what I would guesstimate to be 30+ hours and even though I've had several freezes past the initial bad one, I've never had to worry about losing gear or my cyber deck upgrades again.

My suggestion to you, even though it might suck a bit, would be to wear your second best gear while you're playing the game until you have that initial hiccup. That way you won't lose anything fantastic. And hopefully your cyberdeck won't get hit.

"Not sure about the builds, but base game revolvers (ballistic and ebergy one) are definetely viable. Beat my first playthrough with the ballistic one on hard difficulty. The thing is that if you plan to shoot the guns you definetely need to have 20 at aiming and handling, so that the spread will be minimal and so the reload. But if you play with controller be ready to have your firing finger aching after a few minutes if constant firing at long range.
If we speak about hancannons, they are not as effective as revolvers due to lacking damage per second. But i do think that some of handcannons shoot through the multiple targets. But the reload is way slower.
And there is also a diamond in the dirt for me, the Minor note which truly shines if you take it with melee. Stun a group of foes and then melee them until they die. A Gem.

As for the builds, i'd say you need to go with at least one healing item (rejuv field tactical or life steal aug, latter is better imo, because you can get better tactical).
I say, for appropriation missions you need one setup of tactical and augs, for the rest you can have different stuff. Boss fights also require some personal approach. But for every gunner homing missiles are good and so is the beam. I also prefer to have i/o converter equipped at all times because i don't like elemental weapons in all the games.",,theascent,r/theascent,2022-09-20T13:32:34.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure about the builds, but base game revolvers (ballistic and ebergy one) are definetely viable.

Not only is The Ascent just a solid twin-stick video game (in the old school sense of the term, turn it on and blow shit up), but the freecam and Photo Mode always always *always* give me a deeper glimpse at the game itself.

Streets that I'm pretty certain we cannot even access, filled with foot traffic. Blade Runner neon umbrellas carried by big ass aliens from The Fifth Element. Robots being interrogated by police. Voice announcements warning of various goings-on. Flying cars and bikes dart around, above, and underneath you. Chrome cityscapes stretch onward for miles. 

It's jawdropping.

"Children of Morta is exactly what you¡¯ll want to try. It¡¯s coop and has a family trials option for end game replayability. This is a must play based on what you said in all your comments.

Another great coop game is Heroes of Hammerwatch. This one takes a second to get but once you do, it¡¯s great fun! Unlocks are great. Lots of replayability.

Lastly, I do recommend the Acent. It¡¯s in my top 5 games of all time. I read all the lore codec and the atmosphere is top tier.

Edit: also try Gloomhaven, ¡®For the King¡¯. For coop that has turn based combat. It¡¯s still hardcore tho. Both games will kick you on your ass. Divinity Original Sin 2 is also turn based combat but it¡¯s a lot of story, so be ready for a longer game here.

"Depends on the diablo and what you like about diablo. If you like diablo 2 like I do, it's not, it's another type of game. 

If you like diablo 3, tho.. it gets more similar. 

It's more of a arcade game gameplay wise. Like Smash TV if you ever played it.

The action is frenetic. So im that regard like d3. Melee weapons are only available if you get the dlc.

Items that drop aren't random generated. They are limited and once you get one weapon named X all other named X will be identical. Upgrading the weapon reaches a cap.. and if you sell that said weapon and another one drops the upgrade will remain.

"Alright, so roll the clock back a year ago - by way of [UUU](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm) it was possible to unlock the developer console and use commands to obtain gear, including the Steam preorder exclusive Bitsplit, and the special vendor promo code weapon Persuader. 

An update or two later, this same trick let out of the bag [4 new weapons the dev team was working on](https://www.reddit.com/r/theascent/comments/phd3pa/4_new_weapons_added_with_latest_patch/) that were not suppose to be included in the game yet - still future DLC weapons at the time. The Brosnan and Recoil kept their name, but the Solution became the F&amp;F Stinger and it seems the En Bomb got relegated to PS exclusive RPEG 33 (which really sucks, because that is the best of the lot by far).

Anyways, shortly after that leak the next patch disabled those weapons and internally disabled the console commands from working anymore. On that note, what you *might* be able to do, assuming that trick still works, is use the classic SteamDB trick to rollback your installation to an old version, start a new save, console command unlock everything and then update it.  (Just make sure you never delete anything)

I posted those 4 weapons right after Patch #2 came out, and by Patch #3 console commands were killed off:

Including all DLC and that PS exclusive weapon which nobody else can get, that brings the weapon count total to 44:

&lt;p&gt;The defender monobot is useless against them and will get wiped out. But the AT4 Turret tanks them and out DPS them easily.&lt;/p&gt;

"It turns out that my wife and I figured out how to finish the Zell mission and work around the multiple bugs in the mission:

1. Do not skip the cutscene when Zell is introducing himself. If you die, don't skip it on your next try. So make sure to watch it completely every time. No matter if you are on your 4th try: do not skip it.
2. Make sure that one of your augmentations is the Tentakill. If for some reason Zell gets stuck with his red shield and stops moving, the Tentakill will get him out of the bug.

With those two considerations, you can finish the expansion with no issues.

Hope this helps!

"Hey everyone, really enjoying the game so far. Been going through the campaign pretty well so far, except I'm at a bad spot. I'm doing the main mission (I'm terrible with names of missions and stuff) where you hold down the area for 2:30. They come at you 3 ways and the enemy is shooting these guided electrical, I guess bullets. I can't get away from them. I have maxed out health, and points in evade and aim. I'm level 16 also.

They come at you 3 ways and the enemy is shooting these guided electrical, I guess bullets. I can&amp;#39;t get away from them. I have maxed out health, and points in evade and aim. I&amp;#39;m level 16 also. I&amp;#39;m running the augs hydraulic slam and the other is the ranger that helps you fight. My mod is the health one.

I used the hydraulic slam for a long time when I started the game, it is very nice. At this moment, the ones I like the more are Tentakill and Homing Mim for enemies that are weak to physical damage and I/O Converter and Mono Ranger for robots-only missions.

"I love this game... it is **WITHOUT A DOUBT** the **BEST GAM**E I've played in the last 2 years.

I still remember feeling shocked when encountering the HUGE Green MECH in the Cosmodrome.

It gave me ""ED-209"" chills from the first Robocop movie (yeah, I'm old). I kept running away as I didn't know how to deal with it...

I'm fully in love with this game and would want the developers to continue building more arcologies, missions, maps, baddies, weapons, gear, etc.

But would it be possible for them to bring **FSR 2.0** to the game ???

**Please upvote to get DEVELOPER attention.**

As said by many, THE ASCENT is Cyberpunk DONE RIGHT.

I don't even play Cyberpunk anymore (even though I haven't finished it)... but would love to continue playing new missions of The Ascent. I still go to Scrapland to fight the big MECHs.

I also loved the jokes from the IMP in the ""romance"" mission (latest update)... would be great adding more jokes like that in future updates.

Also happy that Kira isn't complaining anymore when accidentally shooting bystanders.

"To people in the comments who are out of the loop, it's graphics processor technology that both Nvidia and AMD have been heavily investing in the last few years on PC designed to allow high resolution games, while still maintaining a high frame rate. Nvidia started the tech, with [their system called DLSS](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/) - Deep Learning Super Sampling. AMD later made their[ own version of this tech called FSR](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/fidelityfx-super-resolution) - FidelityFX Super Resolution. 

Basically a game is rendered at a lower native resolution, and then using an extremely sophisticated A.I. engine, its upsampled in realtime to the desired output resolution. This system takes a huge strain off the GPU , which is usually maxed out in most video games, and frees up resources to increase the framerate. DLSS has been a massive advantage to PC gamers for a while now, with the tech first showing up in 2019. When DLSS 2.0 came out, it is becoming increasingly difficult to almost impossible to tell the difference between full native resolution, and AI upscaled.

AMD announced the 2.0 update to their FSR engine is now available in the devkits for both Playstation 5 and Xbox Series S/X this year - and if more devs start using it, we can see ramped up graphics settings (lighting, shadows, texture quality, resolution, etc.) on consoles while still having 60 and 120fps gameplay options. The bigger pipedream is AI supersampling freeing up enough GPU resources to allow ray tracing in console games.",,theascent,r/theascent,2022-09-06T19:48:54.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To people in the comments who are out of the loop, it&amp;#39;s graphics processor technology that both Nvidia and AMD have been heavily investing in the last few years on PC designed to allow high resolution games, while still maintaining a high frame rate. Nvidia started the tech, with &lt;a href=""https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/""&gt;their system called DLSS&lt;/a&gt; - Deep Learning Super Sampling. AMD later made their&lt;a href=""https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/fidelityfx-super-resolution""&gt; own version of this tech called FSR&lt;/a&gt; - FidelityFX Super Resolution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically a game is rendered at a lower native resolution, and then using an extremely sophisticated A.I. engine, its upsampled in realtime to the desired output resolution. This system takes a huge strain off the GPU , which is usually maxed out in most video games, and frees up resources to increase the framerate.

Turned it on - 100 fps! :)   I watch digital foundry so I have a few things to look at.  Edges and ""wires"" that in game and notice a little dithering and jagged lines but nothing all that bad.

"Look, I realize taste is a very personal thing...

But to give you an idea: I was a huge D&amp;D fan (books &amp; dice)... and Diablo II.

D&amp;D was all imagination, Diablo II was 640x480 graphics w/256 colors &amp; crap audio.

Later, I loved the ShadhowRun series, the dystopian future (e.g. Bladerunner).

The problem was combat, Shadowrun is turn based... where you can't really ask for much. Great storyline, character development, etc.

In the case of The Ascent, the visuals are just INCREDIBLE. Unreal Engine 4 at its best.

When you use the camera mode (with ""P"") you realize the game is completely 3D, with amazing artwork, design and details. The art director really flexed with this game. And when you find out it was developed by 12 people, it's mind-blowing.

The music is AMAZING... there's a tune you'll hear the whole game, which varies from the lower levels to the pinnacle. Also the turbo viper theme, when you begin combat... which is when you know bullets will fly for a while.

The action is thrilling... mostly at the start &amp; lower levels, where just a few turbo viper punks can kill you. As you progress, get stronger and develop skills to duck and cover, you learn to deal with ANYTHING. Maybe the spiders are still overpowered... or shooting at an explosive barrel accidentally (in proximity), which will get you killed. The rest of the enemies, provided you progress with the missions timely, is completely doable (I would say ""average"" difficulty).

If you try to skip levels... or mission difficulty recommendation, you'll get decimated with 1 shot.

The last main mission is HARD, particularly the last room, because there are endless waves of enemies. And by endless, I mean endless. You need to manage health and power to be able to cast spells and avoid damage.

On the RPG side... it is probably NOT its main strength, if you expected endless weapons with rarity items, etc (ala Diablo II). But for a casual player, it is perfectly balanced, 4 shotgun options, 4 miniguns, 10 pistols, 10 machine guns, 3 rocket launchers, 2 swords, bat, hammer, etc.... all are decent... but only after getting the ""dealbreaker"" you realize you can overpower enemies with firepower. Otherwise, you need to duck and cover to reload.

The cosmetics on the character are fine... perhaps too many tattoos, shirts and dress options. Also, sometimes the best looking aren't the best in stats, but u can now solve that with the transmog stores.

Maybe the enemy types can be a weak spot. There should be more diversity. Once you understand how to deal with regular humans, it can sometimes be repetitive. The rats are also fun to fight against (when you are in the sewers), but the rest can feel repetitive. The ONLY exception ONCE AGAIN, are the MECH spiders. They can be challenging... when you face them, you better have your ""A"" GAME, cause you can easily die.

I don't know if it was COVID or the corporate slave story (as I feel like an indent at my job)... but the game was awesome. I kept playing hoping it wouldn't end.

I'm even asking myself if procedural levels would make sense for it... just to allow you to play endlessly.

I beat the game twice in normal mode and then once in NG+ mode, plus the expansion (which brings serious changes to the game, in terms of hordes, claustrophobic passages, different camera angles, etc.

I just hope the twelve apostles behind this game continue expanding it and make it a franchise. The game is miles ahead of Cyberbug 2077... yet only due to marketing budget allocation, most reviewers (Gamespot, etc.) gave the Cybertrash 2077 game a high score, while snubbing The Ascent. It is OBVIOUS that the big studios pay for better reviews.

The ASCENT is a true gem. If they need cash, they can just gofundme for the next expansions... I'm sure they'll meet their financial goals in 1 just hour. These guys are GENIUSES. If they launch an IPO, I'm buying their stock.

Please share your feedback and let me know if I'm just a niche player... or if you felt the same way about the game.",,theascent,r/theascent,2022-09-09T22:15:36.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look, I realize taste is a very personal thing...&lt;/p&gt;

"Yeah, I played Diablo 1 on PC. I also had a NES in the late 80's that was my gateway to console gaming (while I played D&amp;D). So I'm old, which makes it HARDER to find games I really want to play or love. This one is a rare exception.

Disco Elysium is another (a completely different type of game, which won TONS of awards). That game is a gem, it seems boring at first, but it accelerates very fast if you are patient. Completely different game. It's a Maniac Mansion click &amp; walk story, with a lot of depth &amp; consequences. An emotional game.

When it comes to the Ascent, I think the COVID shutdowns and the indent slave backstory played a role to get me interested. The timing of the launch couldn't have been better. I even think they got boosted by Cybertrash 2077.. and I think the game is really miles ahead of it (at least for me).

The first missions are a nice intro. But the depth of the maps and details will continue surprising you. The game touches on political/economic/corporate issues, which shows you the developers added a healthy dose of realism, humor and corruption to the game, just to keep it real. The approach towards ""The Feed"" media is also quite hilarious... very corporate and dystopian.

The graphical artwork and details are amazing. There's a part when you see many soldiers guarding a location... and minutes later, you come back and see things have radically changed. No spoilers, but you'll notice it.

I struggled with the reading too. The inventory menu is a bit complicated at first. Luckily, there isn't much that truly needs reading. There's a codex, which I barely glanced for the artwork, but didn't read much. You can get all you need from your boss Poone, the big giant at the bar (I think his name is drummer)... and later 2 more characters which suppport you.

The gear feature is also important... as you should remember to change it after you start finding better pants/clothing/hats. If you forget, you're only making things harder for yourself.

Skill points are important to level your character up...  they play a KEY role to determine which enemies you can face without dying immediately. If you are level 5 and face a level 20 enemy, you will die. You'll notice a skull on top of enemies you can't face yet, so when you see them, RUN in the opposite direction (the game is incredibly unfair if you face those enemies).

As the game is open world, you can literally go to places where the toughest enemies are... and keep dying there, without scratching a single enemy.

I once made it deep into a tough area... only to realize the game was unplayable... and struggled to make it out (as the save point was already deep into a tough neighborhood). I got lucky after 10 minutes and left. It did it to find the overwhelmer, which is a very powerful rifle.

The hydraulic slam is the ryu/ken hadouken. Really fun... but once you level up, there are better much augs, some send mechanical drones to fight your enemies, support drones, support guns/robots, or better yet keep your life meter high. Eventually, I realized that dishing damage is important, distracting enemies with bots is cool, but keeping a high health bar is paramount to surviving.

The weapons you'll get towards the end of the game are very powerful (there's an RPG and a minigun which are key). Don't spend the special parts on any early weapons... wait until you get stronger ones (the overwhelmer is key, as it is the only weapon with 2 types of damage). Invest your parts into that weapon first. You'll get it early mid-game (you can try getting it very early, but you need to follow the youtube suggestions to avoid the tough baddies and make it out alive.

Towards the end of the game, the dealbreaker is undeniably the best weapon for hordes of enemies. Make sure you get all the loot you can and you'll find it (some of it is unreachable at first, so you'll have to come back for it). The dealbreaker is my main weapon and I only began using swords after playing the update and getting to level 45. Swords deal tons of area damage and are fun, but only use them after finishing the game.

I gave helldivers a look on youtube. Seems interesting. Any other suggestions?

In closing, I can't put my finger on what exactly hooked me into this game... I know it is more than one thing for sure. The graphics, music, ambient, gun sounds and backstory played a HUGE role. Seeing concrete break from shooting is also a nice touch... a ton of breakable walls in the update provide more depth to the game. The multiplayer is also fun.

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I can&amp;#39;t put my finger on what exactly hooked me into this game... I know it is more than one thing for sure. The graphics, music, ambient, gun sounds and backstory played a HUGE role. Seeing concrete break from shooting is also a nice touch... a ton of breakable walls in the update provide more depth to the game. The multiplayer is also fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your battle versus the first MECH !... you literally have to run circles around it to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

"Well thanks for your input. Enjoyed the read. I did 3 side missions and picked up another. I think I'm on the 3rd main mission. Starting to get the hang of crouching and shooting over cover. I ran into to the level 20 guys already. 1 hit me immediately. There were inside a bar (I think it was a bar), so I didn't even know they were in there til it was too late. 

The map is a bit wonky, but I found out about the little path giver that made it super easy. Took me a minute to find out how to throw a grenade. Once I get all these nuances down, it'll get easier. I've been putting skill points in health, evasion, critical hit and aim mostly. Then been peppering some points in weapon handling and body battery. So far I'm enjoying it. Of course I'm busy this weekend so I won't be getting much time in like I want. 

Other twin stick shooters that I know of besides HellDivers are Alien Nation and Dead Nation (PlayStation exclusives). There is one on Steam called Anvil. There is a demo to try. Its more rouge-like style. Another one I just thought of was The Rift Breaker. That is more of a tower defense game, but it was fun.

Keep the components for the best weapons... they can be upgraded with the gun specialist (hammer icon on the map). Weapons can reach level 13 making them deal more damage.

However, you should only use the components on the stronger guns you will use towards the end (Overwhelmer, RPG and the DealBreaker).

"The short answer, no. Long answer, it¡¯s not as bad as it was. Not even close. But it still bugs some. It¡¯s playable, I haven¡¯t seen much game breaking except one mission on the DLC. If you quit while on the train, headed to the MG Military base, before you actually get there- or clip through the floor, or lose power or internet etc - you won¡¯t be able to complete or restart the mission. I¡¯ve seen it happen a few different ways, and read it happen to multiple people.

Don¡¯t kill em too quickly. 

Little stuff like that. But not like it was. All of this being said, I¡¯ve gotten 100% completion through my first play through. So, idk. The issues that ARE out there, seem to be incredibly inconsistent in terms of which console or PC has the issues. 2 people using the exact same console will experience 2 different sets of issues, it seems. I play on series x. I¡¯ve seen countless posts of people with game breaking bugs and issues that Ive never seen, and we will be on the same console.

Take all of this with a grain of salt. 

I would recommend hopping on the free gamepass version for a while before spending money on the DLC, and see if it is smooth enough for your tastes.

"TL;DR: The Voidcutter is probably the Overwhelmer of melee weapons.

It's an energy damage version of the Guillotine katana. Has the same stats and damage output, but energy instead of physical damage means its extra effective against robots as well, which normally seem to have a bit more protection against physical damage. I have this fully upgraded (normal difficulty, not on NG+) and it takes out regular grunts in 1-2 hits, maybe a couple more for tougher enemies. Each swing has a decently wide area of effect too which means you can hit multiple enemies per attack if the're close enough. Or you can hit everything around you by triggering the special whirlwind attack by holding the aim button then just walk right into a mob and watch everything drop like flies. Pair this with Javelin Dash or something and you can dart around and slash things up like some kinda cyberpunk samurai.

You can find it at the end of an unmarked dungeon - the entrance is along the southeastern side of the map. Just hug that wall after exiting the hub area and you'll find it eventually. There's [this video](https://youtu.be/1w1dNnjalyU?t=15) that shows where it is. Be warned - when I got to the last room with the chest, I might have triggered a glitch where enemies endlessly spawned so make sure you grab it quickly.",,,r/theascent,2022-09-02T14:54:06.000Z,post,,,Discussion,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: The Voidcutter is probably the Overwhelmer of melee weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

"I don¡¯t hate the game but¡¦ at the same time, I can understand scoring it so low.

There are long, arduous stretches of this game where nothing happens. There are stationary enemies that exist only to be taken out from cover as you slowly watch their health dissolve. Side missions are often little more than pest control.

There are two types of bad games; those that are simply unpleasant to play and those that are so bland there is little to even say about them. The Ascent falls into the latter. The gunplay *does* feel good but playing it *simply feels like work* half the time. That¡¯s before we go into the deeper problems of its difficulty imbalances, glitches, rudimentary loot system and poor player feedback (missions being administered when not yet accessible, for example).

"PSA: I figured out the cause.   
Sometimes, if you immediately run/roll towards the boss as soon as fight starts, his second add doesn't spawn. So the fight begins with boss + 1 add. In that case you basically skip one enemy (make the encounter somewhat easier) but by the time you kill everyone, the game doesn't register all enemies to be dead and initiate the cutscene.  
So just wait half a second before moving when the game starts to make sure fight begins with boss + 2 adds, then go ahead and kill everyone. It worked for me.  
I saw on a forum (maybe here, maybe PSNP, not sure) that someone advising to not skip the pre-fight cutscene and watch it fully. I can confirm that it doesn't have to do with anything and doesn't make a difference.

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for that info.. the coop experience is the shits.. and I like the game so much, we are pushing through anyways.. we¡¯ve completed the main game and are working on the expansion. Honestly we¡¯ve spent almost as much time reloading after crashes, and waiting on load screens as we have playing..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I¡¯m not just talking shit.. I think this game is awesome.. it¡¯s beautiful in that blade runner, dystopian, cyberpunk way.. it actually plays butter smooth on my series x. But coop needs serious love.&lt;/p&gt;

"Graphics: 10

Gameplay: 5

Content: 3

Don't get  me wrong, I like the game and it is absolutely gorgeous and worth buying for the visual experience alone, but combat is clunky and repetitive and the missions are over all too soon, and then there's nothing to do.

Loot/progression/stats system is not great so you can't go around finding new cool stuff either. It's not like say, Arcanum (made by even fewer devs) where there's literally 100+ hours of content and you can just run/break into almost any building and there's some actual story or something cool to find in most of them. And after 50 hours the are still new abilities/skills/stats that you really want to invest in for your character, or loot to find that really makes a difference.

Then there's the bugs and crashes, part of it can be forgiven because of the state Unreal Engine is in right now ( the bare engine sometimes it just crashes by itself just for having running for an hour lol, god forbid you are actually making it do anything fancy), but the fact that the game doesn't create frequent and multiple local back ups of the save files is unforgivable as that's just trivial to implement.

All in all Ascent is a very shallow barebones action game with the RPG parts (story/choices/progression/gear/content) sorely lacking, and unfortunately this latest DLC just makes it clear that additional content (story/missions/combat zones/characters/enemies) takes too long to develop with their current workflows and they're not able/willing to address the fundamental systemic flaws of the game (loot/progression/stats/clunky combat gameplay).

To me it just feels odd, either you make a narrative game and then you have a deep, long, satisfying story, or you go more RPG and then it's stats/loot/progression/clearing out bosses and raiding ""dungeons"". Ascent seems to lean in the former direction, but then lacks the actual narrative content, with the story being rather dull and predictable. I did talk to almost every NPC I could find and read every datapad, but most of the time it's just filler.

There was one door near that hackers den with the papa feral inside that briefly made me hopeful that there would actually be stuff to find off the beaten path, and I kind of expected there was much, much more of that sort of content to be found in the game and that you'd actually find skills/gear/whatever in these kinds of places.

Quests still don't go beyond ""go here and interact"" or ""go here and kill this guy"" or ""go here and defend this spot for 2 minutes"", with the go here part being annoying because you're constantly attacked by a handful of the same enemies. The walking parts and being constantly attacked by those gangsters that are the same boring fight while offering nothing to loot really frustrates me to no end.

This game reminds me of the days of PlayStation 1 games. Without a lot of bells and whistles. It gets to the point and creates a perfect atmosphere.
No (in my eyes) pointless endgame.
It&amp;#39;s actually a game that really grabbed me by the balls.
As for the bugs, I&amp;#39;m glad I can&amp;#39;t say anything about them, because I didn&amp;#39;t notice any. Except for 1 or 2 that affect the skills.
I must have been really lucky.

"Right, I get your perspective too. And yes, Ascent has the typical console game formula that offers more of a cinematic experience but is relatively straightforward gameplay and content wise.

I'm a PC player so I'm the opposite, I don't care about graphics at all, as long as the game has sufficient depth, story, progression or just generally controls/plays nice, which I don't think this game does - combat plays terribly clunky in my opinion (eg poor animations, poor readability, poor feedback, uninteresting weapon firing patterns, unintentionally getting stuck in environment objects all the time).

I definitely think the base game is worth its price, but I'm very disappointed by the DLC in more ways than one. I thought they had just released the base game at a rush as minimum viable product for business reasons, and MUCH more content would come afterwards. If it takes them 6 months to add only 4 missions / 2 hours worth of content to the game, that just feels bad and gives no hope for the future...

If I were a dev on this I'd populate the existing zones with more content before adding new big outdoor zones with big new art pieces, like adding more of those Papa Feral indoor lairs (that door in the flooded area) or other small self-contained indoor locations that have a little specific encounter. And to spice up the encounters, I'd make variants of existing enemies but just give them new attacks, eg that big walker mech can just get a different color and have a different set of attacks/fire patterns.",,theascent,r/theascent,2022-08-27T09:24:42.000Z,comment,,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, I get your perspective too.

"PSA: I figured out the cause.  
Sometimes, if you immediately run/roll towards the boss as soon as fight starts, his second add doesn't spawn. So the fight begins with boss + 1 add. In that case you basically skip one enemy (make the encounter somewhat easier) but by the time you kill everyone, the game doesn't register all enemies to be dead and initiate the cutscene.  
So just wait half a second before moving when the game starts to make sure fight begins with boss + 2 adds, then go ahead and kill everyone. It worked for me.  
I saw on a forum (maybe here, maybe PSNP, not sure) that someone advising to not skip the pre-fight cutscene and watch it fully. I can confirm that it doesn't have to do with anything and doesn't make a difference.

check if there's an old enough cloud sync there, then just download the files and drop the files to the save -folder (https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Ascent#Save_game_data_location).

&lt;p&gt;check if there&amp;#39;s an old enough cloud sync there, then just download the files and drop the files to the save -folder (&lt;a href=""https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Ascent#Save_game_data_location""&gt;https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Ascent#Save_game_data_location&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, do take backups if there&amp;#39;s any other characters/saves you don&amp;#39;t want to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth a shot, imo?&lt;/p&gt;

"Bought this game today on PS5 and also the DLC. I saw that the DLC had this cool katana weapon called the guillotine and wanted it so bad cuz I want to play the whole story campaign carrying it around. I'm just that kind of gamer who likes to feel overpowered early and I love melee weapons especially swords and all. Then I found out that the Cyber Heist DLC can only be accessed post main story. It broke my heart. 

But I was reading about the Co-op mission reset where if you wanna start over with a character that already has lot of weapons, you only need to make a new save, let the new save file be the host, let your high level character join that host, and the high level character's missions will sync with the host's missions. 

So theoretically, if I were to join a host who is already post main story and has the Cyber Heist DLC, would it be possible for me to:
1. Make a new save file and letting that new save file join my main character file, syncing the new file's missions to mine.
2. Make my main character file JOIN a person with the Cyber Heist DLC that is already post main story
3. Grab the GUILLOTINE weapon from there
4. Leave the host
5. Make the new save file I made at step 1 the host
6. Join the new save file
7. Recovering my mission progress to where I left it but now with the Guillotine in my inventory

"I've played around extensively comparing the XSX and Windows Store versions - there is no ray tracing on the Xbox version, and on PC it seriously taxes the GPU causing a big drop in performance.

Honestly, the Series X version runs a little sad compared to even a mid-low end PC. I tested it against a friend's laptop running a 2060  with everything set to ultra and even an external sata based SSD, and the laptop was soundly beating the XSX version in every area - loading time, frame rate, texture pop in. The PC version had the benefit of DLSS which is a huge factor, as I don't think Xbox release has the benefit of FSR but I could be wrong.

So imagining they do make a ray tracing option, it will almost certainly halve the frame rate to 30fps, drop the resolution, and ideally make use of FSR 2.0 in the newer SDK.

As for the comment mentioning HDR - only if it's a native HDR10 output from the get go that's optimized for it. Doing forced HDR, even with ReShade looks like absolute ass. There is a reason MS hasn't made this an AutoHDR title, it's very much polished for the SDR spectrum. If you tune your monitor/tv right, it looks gorgeous as is.

I was in the "" let's HDR everything"" camp for a while, but I had some sense smacked into me by a photographer who showed me how awful sudo converted/forced HDR is, and the true potential of SDR if done right.

*Edit*
Here's a top end PC with a 3080 using DLSS, and toggling RT on tanks the frame rate from 110+ to just above 40:

I tested it against a friend&amp;#39;s laptop running a 2060  with everything set to ultra and even an external sata based SSD, and the laptop was soundly beating the XSX version in every area - loading time, frame rate, texture pop in. The PC version had the benefit of DLSS which is a huge factor, as I don&amp;#39;t think Xbox release has the benefit of FSR but I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So imagining they do make a ray tracing option, it will almost certainly halve the frame rate to 30fps, drop the resolution, and ideally make use of FSR 2.0 in the newer SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the comment mentioning HDR - only if it&amp;#39;s a native HDR10 output from the get go that&amp;#39;s optimized for it. Doing forced HDR, even with ReShade looks like absolute ass. There is a reason MS hasn&amp;#39;t made this an AutoHDR title, it&amp;#39;s very much polished for the SDR spectrum. If you tune your monitor/tv right, it looks gorgeous as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in the &amp;quot; let&amp;#39;s HDR everything&amp;quot; camp for a while, but I had some sense smacked into me by a photographer who showed me how awful sudo converted/forced HDR is, and the true potential of SDR if done right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a top end PC with a 3080 using DLSS, and toggling RT on tanks the frame rate from 110+ to just above 40:

"Just ran into a serious couch co-op issue on ps5. My son and I are playing together, he is hosting and I¡¯m the 2nd player. We ended our 4th or 5th session about 4 days ago.

I checked my save file on the ps5 under my account and it was from a few hours before we had ended the session, so it never saved properly for me as the 2nd player. But it did for him as the host.

We just reached Pinnacle tonight and he¡¯s level 20 now, but I¡¯ll be back on level 17 stuck there again.

Tried everything we could to make the game save for me by doing missions, traveling around, etc. But it just won¡¯t save my progress as the 2nd player. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just reached Pinnacle tonight and he¡¯s level 20 now, but I¡¯ll be back on level 17 stuck there again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I¡¯m not sure how far from the end we are, but if we can¡¯t beat the game in one long session next time, we might just have to quit playing this game. It sucks that this game has been out for a few years and in this seriously broken! Is Neon Giant going to fix it?!&lt;/p&gt;

"My wife and I are playing NG+,  and we are almost all the way through the campaign again.   When we jumped into a cab to go to Black Rock,  we got stuck in a neverending cab ride.   She exited the fame first,  ensuring that it showed a recent save.  It showed it was saved 56 seconds prior.   I logged out after,  and it showed my last save as a little over a minute.

We restart the game, and the level 38 character she was playing is nowhere to be found.   There is only a level 36 that has none of her equipped items or any of the Atmore pieces she had purchased.

To make it weirder,  if she logs in alone,  the ""missing""  character is there for her to use in single player... But it doesn't register its for a NG+ campaign,  even though it's level 38.

When we jumped into a cab to go to Black Rock,  we got stuck in a neverending cab ride.   She exited the fame first,  ensuring that it showed a recent save.  It showed it was saved 56 seconds prior.   I logged out after,  and it showed my last save as a little over a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We restart the game, and the level 38 character she was playing is nowhere to be found.   There is only a level 36 that has none of her equipped items or any of the Atmore pieces she had purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it weirder,  if she logs in alone,  the &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot;  character is there for her to use in single player... But it doesn&amp;#39;t register its for a NG+ campaign,  even though it&amp;#39;s level 38. &lt;/p&gt;

"Want to second this problem. Partially I had trouble with the boss because I hadn't played in a year and I'd forgotten how to actually hit things playing double-sticked, so once I remembered that the fight got a lot easier.

But first time I killed him, I got the trophy for killing him but the game just stuck like the fight was still ongoing even though there was no one on the platform. I finally reloaded to try again.

That time, in the ambush room in front of Zell, I just barely won that fight and staggered out of it on fire, and died at the beginning of the next room. Well, that tripped the ""lock the ambush room door"" but I didn't get far enough to change my spawn point to the next room, so I respawned in front of the locked door...and had to quit and reload a save again.

Third time, I got to Zell and just got a series of really good hits and he dropped to 50% almost instantly. He put on his immortality shield and...just stood there, not shooting, not moving, just shielded. Shield never went away.

So...I'm thinking I'm gonna wait for a patch on this one.

Finally, the one bit of information I've seen on here about how to escape the fight not ending was [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/theascent/comments/wshg6p/comment/il1heqy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from /u/IsaacBrigs: ""...I figured out that I need to not dice the guy into pieces with the katana so he could exist for the cutscene.""

Anyway, hope that helpful to someone and also hope they patch that fight, how frustrating. I'm now stuck in that area and can't leave until they fix this (other than starting a new game of course).

"PSA: I figured out the cause. (for OP's case. Not Tall-Way757's)

Sometimes, if you immediately run/roll towards the boss as soon as fight starts, his second add doesn't spawn. So the fight begins with boss + 1 add. In that case you basically skip one enemy (make the encounter somewhat easier) but by the time you kill everyone, the game doesn't register all enemies to be dead and initiate the cutscene.

So just wait half a second before moving when the game starts to make sure fight begins with boss + 2 adds, then go ahead and kill everyone. It worked for me.

I saw on a forum (maybe here, maybe PSNP, not sure) that someone advising to not skip the pre-fight cutscene and watch it fully. I can confirm that it doesn't have to do with anything and doesn't make a difference.

I feel their core gameplay and art design etc is amazing. It would really use like AA type investment and polish. Things like the economy, game balance, QOL adjustments etc  just aren't there.

Things like the economy, game balance, QOL adjustments etc  just aren&amp;#39;t there. I would love to see more itemization like a more traditional hands and feet. Ability to swap to a second loadout ala Diablo 2 etc.    As it stands by the time you reach the cyberheist DLC there&amp;#39;s really nothing else to level gear wise. My weapons are already max level.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if there was some reason to actually collect bounties because 1K is nothing. Perhaps a favor system or vendor discount for a given area, basic components, the ability to breakdown useless weapons into upgrade resources.&lt;/p&gt;

Here¡¯s the stupid part in my opinion. Both are characters are lvl 27. Upon loading the game I have the option to do new game + etc.  however my friend can¡¯t. He has no option for new game + or the ability to even join me. Even if both are characters beat the game on my world.

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a saying in game dev, &amp;quot;players will always try to optimize the fun out of a game.&amp;quot; This suggestion is that.&lt;/p&gt;
